This study aims to quantify racial–nativity inequalities in multimorbidity prev-</p><p>alence ≥3 chronic conditions), access to primary care, and relations to past-year subjective unmet health care needs (SUN) </p><p>among older Canadians.</p><p>Methods: Population-based data were drawn from the Canadian Community Health Survey (2015–2018). Multivariable </p><p>logistic regression was performed to estimate the likelihood of multimorbidity, sites of usual source of primary care (USOC), </p><p>primary care coordination, and multidimensional aspects of SUN. The Classification and Regression Tree (CART) was ap-</p><p>plied to identify intersecting determinants of SUN.</p><p>Results: The overall sample (n = 19,020) were predominantly (69.4%) Canadian-born (CB) Whites (1% CB non-Whites, </p><p>18.1% White immigrants, and 11.5% racialized immigrants). Compared with CB Whites, racialized immigrants were more </p><p>likely to have multimorbidity (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.35, 99% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13–1.61), lack a USOC </p><p>(AOR = 1.41, 99% CI: 1.07–1.84), and report higher SUN (AOR = 1.47, 99% CI: 1.02–2.11). Racialized immigrants’ </p><p>greater SUN was driven by heightened affordability barriers (AOR = 4.31, 99% CI: 2.02–9.16), acceptability barriers </p><p>(AOR = 3.11, 99% CI: 1.90–5.10), and unmet needs for chronic care (AOR = 2.71, 99% CI: 1.53–4.80) than CB Whites. </p><p>The CART analysis found that the racial–nativity gap in SUN perception was still evident even among those who had access </p><p>to nonpoorly coordinated care.</p><p>Discussion: To achieve an equitable chronic care system, efforts need to tackle affordability barriers, improve service ac-</p><p>ceptability, minimize service fragmentation, and reallocate treatment resources to underserved older racialized immigrants </p><p>in Canada.</p><p>Keywords:  Complex health care needs, Health care equity, Minority ageing, Social determinants of health</p><p>  </p><p>As the world’s population is aging rapidly, multimorbidity </p><p>has become a global public health challenge (Beard et al., </p><p>2016).

Multimorbid patients </p><p>constitute a fragile and complicated population with an </p><p>elevated risk of mortality (Barnett et al., 2012), increased </p><p>health care utilization (Tinetti et  al., 2012), and greater </p><p>unmet care needs (Kim et al., 2020). Despite the predomi-</p><p>nance of multimorbidity, care delivery for this patient pop-</p><p>ulation tends to be less effective (Kuipers et al., 2020) and </p><p>often uncoordinated (Salisbury et al., 2011; Schoen et al., </p><p>2009). In developed nations, fragmentation problems of </p><p>health services were frequently reported among older adults, </p><p>such as test results unavailable at appointment and the lack </p><p>of communication between family doctors and specialists </p><p>(Osborn et al., 2014). Primary health systems traditionally </p><p>focus on managing a single acute illness, rather than co-</p><p>ordination of care for chronic disease clustering (Osborn </p><p>et al., 2015); there are challenges to providing treatment </p><p>for patients with multimorbidity (Kim et al., 2020).</p><p>Although primary care reform has been implemented </p><p>across Canada to leverage patient-centered care (Rosser </p><p>et al., 2011), many Canadians still did not receive adequate </p><p>treatments to manage their complex long-term health con-</p><p>ditions (Ronksley et al., 2012). Although there is abundant </p><p>literature focusing on the prevalence and inequalities of </p><p>multimorbidity (Quiñones et al., 2016), few have investi-</p><p>gated this health consequence among late-life racialized im-</p><p>migrants, their coping behaviors of accessing primary care </p><p>and whether their health care needs are equitably met in the </p><p>host society. Canada’s demographic landscape was trans-</p><p>formed to be more multicultural and multiethnic, resulting </p><p>from an increasing inflow of racialized immigrant popu-</p><p>lations from the Global South, made possible by the abo-</p><p>lition of racially discriminatory immigration policy since </p><p>the 1970s (Laroche, 2000; Triadafilopoulos, 2010). On a </p><p>global scale, immigrants are susceptible to poor access to </p><p>care as cross-border migration often entails realignment to </p><p>a new environment, in which they may face multifaceted </p><p>barriers such as unfamiliarity with the local health care de-</p><p>livery, linguistic obstacles, cultural misinterpretation, and </p><p>discrimination (Castañeda et al., 2015). However, in the </p><p>Canadian primary care system where care is free at the </p><p>point of service, previous findings on nativity equity remain </p><p>somewhat inconclusive across different access-to-care indi-</p><p>cators, with no clear pattern of a systematic disadvantage </p><p>of immigrants relative to Canadian-born (CB) adults. Some </p><p>studies found that there were no immigration-based dis-</p><p>parities in access to regular care (Lebrun & Shi, 2011; Prus </p><p>et al., 2010; Setia et al., 2011) and even fewer unmet health </p><p>care needs among immigrants, compared with those born </p><p>in Canada (Setia et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2005). In sharp </p><p>contrast, other inquiries suggest that immigrants were more </p><p>likely to lack a regular doctor (Lasser et al., 2006; Siddiqi </p><p>et al., 2009), especially recent immigrants (McDonald & </p><p>Kennedy, 2004).</p><p>Contemporary immigration scholarship has typically </p><p>treated immigrants with diverse racial backgrounds as a </p><p>monolithic population, leading to the results largely driven </p><p>by the dominant working-age White immigrants (Brown, </p><p>2018). This homogenized approach could be biased for </p><p>racialized immigrants, considering that they are remark-</p><p>ably younger than CB populations and their exposure to </p><p>discrimination differs from European immigrants. The in-</p><p>visibility of racialization in immigrant research has been </p><p>criticized for its European-centric worldview (Erel et  al., </p><p>2016; Sáenz & Manges Douglas, 2015). This is a serious </p><p>shortcoming because multiple jeopardies including race/</p><p>ethnicity, language barriers, and cultural differences may </p><p>distinctively impact racialized immigrants’ ability to access </p><p>health-enhancing resources (Koehn et al., 2013; Lin, 2021). </p><p>As such, three theoretical propositions—healthy immigrant </p><p>effect, structural othering hypothesis, and cumulative dis-</p><p>advantage approach—are essential to understand how na-</p><p>tivity and race (re)shape health and health care inequalities </p><p>over time.</p><p>The healthy immigrant explanation asserts that migrants </p><p>with established human capital are self-selected of the or-</p><p>igin population and might systematically differ from those </p><p>who prefer to stay in the sending countries, and at the in-</p><p>stitutional level, receiving countries’ merit-based admission </p><p>policy further impose another layer of selection in screening </p><p>immigrants who are healthier upon arrival than their </p><p>host populations (Vang et al., 2017). However, this effect </p><p>erodes with increasing duration of residence (McDonald & </p><p>Kennedy, 2004). Alternatively, the structural othering hy-</p><p>pothesis proposes that the health decline among immigrants </p><p>is attributable to more than individual-based acculturative </p><p>stressors but structural deprivations when adapting to a </p><p>mainstream society that privileges Whiteness and European </p><p>descendants (Viruell-Fuentes, 2007; Viruell-Fuentes et al., </p><p>2012). Therefore, racialized immigrants might not share an </p><p>equal opportunity to access societal resources, primarily </p><p>due to power imbalance apparent in structural racism and </p><p>anti-immigrant sentiment (Brown, 2018; Williams et  al., </p><p>2010). Furthermore, the cumulative disadvantage theory </p><p>argues that early-life structural vulnerability could con-</p><p>tribute to greater disadvantages and adversities later in the </p><p>life course (Angel et al., 2001; Ferraro et al., 2006). The </p><p>cumulative disadvantage affecting immigrants could mani-</p><p>fest through institutionalized discriminatory treatments by </p><p>health care providers and employers, resulting in widening </p><p>health inequalities into advanced old age (Levchenko, </p><p>2021). Correspondingly, it remains unclear how health </p><p>profiles of racialized immigrants may differ from domestic-</p><p>born White populations in late-life stages, and whether </p><p>old age could alter the joint impact of race and nativity on </p><p>health care access to manage chronic illnesses, particularly </p><p>about the usual source of care, coordination of care, and </p><p>consequential unmet needs for care under Canada’s uni-</p><p>versal health system.

The CCHS is an an-</p><p>nual cross-sectional survey conducted by Statistics Canada </p><p>that collects information related to health status and health </p><p>care utilization among the Canadian populations aged 12 </p><p>and older in all provinces and territories. A  detailed ex-</p><p>planation of the complete CCHS survey methodology can </p><p>be found elsewhere (Statistics Canada, 2018). The analysis </p><p>only included respondents (n = 82,317) who participated </p><p>in the “Unmet care needs” module across seven health re-</p><p>gions (i.e., Ontario, Manitoba, Alberta, Newfoundland </p><p>and Labrador, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Northwest </p><p>Territories). The sample was further restricted to partici-</p><p>pants aged 65 and older (n = 22,531) as it is the standard </p><p>retirement age to receive pension benefits in Canada. Those </p><p>with missing data on key variables were excluded from the </p><p>analyses (n = 3,511, 15.6%). This yielded a final analytic </p><p>sample of 19,020.</p><p>Key Outcome Variables</p><p>The outcome variables captured both health conditions, </p><p>health care access and quality, and unmet health care needs </p><p>to present a robust picture of patient experience. Detailed </p><p>response options were given in Table 1.</p><p>Chronic disease multimorbidity was conceptualized as </p><p>the concurrent existence of ≥3 out of 11 long-term condi-</p><p>tions consistently reported across four CCHS cycles (2015–</p><p>2018), including arthritis, high blood pressure, high blood </p><p>cholesterol, diabetes, heart disease, chronic obstructive pul-</p><p>monary disease (COPD), asthma, cancer, stroke, mood dis-</p><p>orders, and anxiety disorders (Romain et al., 2019). These </p><p>chronic conditions were expected to last 6 months or more </p><p>and were diagnosed by a health professional. Three case </p><p>definitions of multimorbidity were used. For logistic regres-</p><p>sion analysis, multimorbidity nominal measure was coded </p><p>into three levels: 0 = no condition; 1 = one to two condi-</p><p>tions; 3 = three or more conditions. For the classification </p><p>tree analysis, multimorbidity additive scale was created </p><p>as a continuous variable (range: 0–11). For the sensitivity </p><p>test, multimorbidity disaggregated cluster was created to </p><p>reflect the total disease burden. This cluster included spe-</p><p>cific chronic diseases in addition to past-month medication </p><p>use (i.e., hypertension, high blood cholesterol, diabetes, and </p><p>current insulin therapy).</p><p>Usual source of care (USOC) serves as the initial point </p><p>of contact with Canada’s health care system that en-</p><p>compasses the diagnosis, treatment, and management of </p><p>medical conditions. Lack a USOC was a binary measure </p><p>(0 = yes; 1 = no) based on the question asking: “Is there a </p><p>place that you usually go to when you need immediate care </p><p>for a minor health problem?”. Site of USOC was based on </p><p>a follow-up question asking: “What kind of place is it?” </p><p>among those who reported having a USOC. It could poten-</p><p>tially provide information about the quality of the care that </p><p>respondents usually received.</p><p>Regular health care provider (HCP) is a direct indicator </p><p>that examines patient attachment (Awe et al., 2019). Lack </p><p>a regular HCP was a binary measure (0 = yes; 1 = no) based </p><p>on the question asking: “Do you have a regular health care </p><p>provider?”. Care coordination of regular HCPs is one in-</p><p>dicator of care performance and well-coordinated care is </p><p>vital for patients with multiple chronic diseases (Maeng </p><p>et al., 2012). Patient-perceived care coordination is only as-</p><p>sessed among respondents who had two or more regular </p><p>providers from a multiple-response list of health allies (see </p><p>Supplementary Material 2) and assessed by the question: </p><p>“How would you rate the level of coordination between </p><p>your regular health care provider and other health profes-</p><p>sionals who provide you with regular care? Would you say </p><p>the coordination is excellent, very good, good, fair, poor?”. </p><p>Respondents were notified with examples of care coordina-</p><p>tion including sending test results on time, communicating </p><p>diagnostic or treatment plans to other health providers.</p><p>Subjective unmet health care need (SUN) is a multifac-</p><p>eted concept for assessing health care inequity and is pre-</p><p>dictive of future health deterioration (Gibson et al., 2019). </p><p>Perception of SUN was assessed by the question: “During </p><p>the past 12 months, was there ever a time when you felt </p><p>that you needed health care but you did not receive it?”. </p><p>SUN for chronic care (Subtype of SUN) was assessed by </p><p>a follow-up question asking respondents who reported </p><p>SUN: “thinking of the most recent time, what was the type </p><p>of care that was needed?” with a multiple-response list of </p><p>services (see Supplementary Material 3) and those who </p><p>selected “treatment of a chronic physical health condition” </p><p>were flagged.

This catego-</p><p>rization was grounded on the seminal work of Statistics </p><p>Canada's Researchers (Chen & Hou, 2002), which was </p><p>widely adopted in subsequent studies (Fikretoglu & Liu, </p><p>2015).</p><p>Main Independent Variable</p><p>Racial–nativity status was based on respondents’ self-</p><p>identified racial/cultural backgrounds and country of or-</p><p>igin and it was conceptualized as a key structural driver of </p><p>inequalities that reflects the social stratification process of </p><p>racialization and migration experiences in shaping power </p><p>differentials (Lin, 2021), in which institutionalized racism </p><p>and nativity-based systemic discrimination may arise </p><p>(Gkiouleka et  al., 2018). This intercategorical construct </p><p>classified respondents into four social positionings: 1 = CB </p><p>Whites (reference), 2 = CB non-Whites; 3 = foreign-born </p><p>(FB) Whites; 4 = racialized immigrants (i.e., FB non-Whites). </p><p>This variable was regarded as more than an individual at-</p><p>tribute but as a product of power structures that “rank </p><p>people into social hierarchies and (re)distribute social deter-</p><p>minants of health” (Gkiouleka et al., 2018). The question </p><p>of “Who is being compared to whom” is critical for con-</p><p>ceptualizing immigrant health research (Kapilashrami & </p><p>Hankivsky, 2018). The assumption of choosing CB Whites </p><p>as the reference category is that it reflects social privileges </p><p>across the “race-migration” nexus in a “White-settler so-</p><p>ciety” tied to its colonial history (Lee & Bhuyan, 2013). It </p><p>should be noted that immigrants (aged ≥65 years) in the </p><p>present sample (n = 3,515) were overwhelmingly long-term </p><p>residents (96.7%, ≥10 years), with only 3.3% being recent </p><p>immigrants who arrived in less than 10 years preceding the </p><p>CCHS survey. Therefore, the immigrant cohort effect could </p><p>not be concurrently tested due to model redundancies.</p><p>Covariates</p><p>To reduce the possibility of spurious associations between </p><p>racial–nativity nexus and health care access, we selected </p><p>potential confounders based on the commonly used </p><p>Andersen’s Behavioral Model of Health Services Use (Alley </p><p>et  al., 2010; Andersen, 1995) and the Socio-ecological </p><p>Model for older racialized immigrants (Lin, 2021). These </p><p>covariates including socioeconomic factors (education, an-</p><p>nual household income, and homeownership), enabling </p><p>factors (marriage, primary language spoken at home, living </p><p>arrangement, community belonging), behavioral health </p><p>(smoking, drinking, physical activity)  and health need </p><p>factors (self-rated health, perceived life stress, body mass </p><p>index).</p><p>Statistical Analysis</p><p>Unweighted statistics were presented to describe sample </p><p>characteristics, whereas a normalized weight was applied </p><p>to produce estimates corrected for the sample size, in </p><p>consistent with prior studies using Statistic Canada’s </p><p>probability-based survey (Lin, 2022a). First, cross-tabula-</p><p>tion analyses were used to compare between-group dif-</p><p>ferences by racial–nativity groups and by past-year SUN. </p><p>Second, to examine racial–nativity disparities in health </p><p>(RQ1), multinomial logistic regression was performed to </p><p>calculate the odds ratios (OR) of multimorbidity prev-</p><p>alence and obesity, while binary logistic regression was </p><p>adopted to estimate the OR of poor/fair self-rated health </p><p>and perceived life stress. Third, racial–nativity disparities in </p><p>usual source of care and care coordination were examined </p><p>based on binary logistic regression and multinomial logistic </p><p>regression, respectively (RQ2).</p><p>Fourth, to investigate the association between racial-</p><p>ized immigrants and SUN (RQ3), five separate binary </p><p>logistic regression analyses were conducted while con-</p><p>trolling for health status, access-to-care indicators, and </p><p>other confounders. One sensitivity test was performed by </p><p>including specific chronic conditions (i.e., multimorbidity </p><p>disaggregated cluster) and medication use to predict SUN. </p><p>Another sensitivity test was conducted to predict SUN </p><p>for chronic care among a subsample of chronically ill </p><p>older adults (n = 15,819). Because models adjusted for all </p><p>covariates were at risk of multiple comparisons, a more </p><p>stringent criterion was employed for the interpretation of </p><p>statistical significance (p < .01) and 99% confidence interval </p><p>(CI) was applied. The multicollinearity diagnostic test was </p><p>checked based on the variance inflation factor (VIF) and </p><p>no predictors had a VIF >5, suggesting collinearity was not </p><p>detected (Vatcheva et al., 2016).</p><p>Lastly, the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) </p><p>algorithms were employed to identify important determin-</p><p>ants of SUN (RQ4) from a pool of 19 potential risk factors. </p><p>As a machine learning technique, decision tree method-</p><p>ology sequentially identifies the strongest predictor that ac-</p><p>counts for the largest amount of variance in the outcome </p><p>by dividing the sample based on the most discriminating </p><p>value. A detailed explanation of the CART modeling can </p><p>be found elsewhere (Lemon et al., 2003; Smits et al., 2008). </p><p>It is critical to establish a priori stopping rules that limit the </p><p>growth of the tree to avoid overfitting. In the present study, </p><p>each child node was required to have a minimum sample </p><p>size of n  =  25, and branching was limited to five levels. </p><p>To select the “optimal” classification tree, cross-validation </p><p>with 10 sample folds was used to calculate misclassification </p><p>risk.

Chi-square statistics revealed that all </p><p>selected covariates were significantly linked to racial– </p><p>nativity status (p < .05). These correlational analyses  </p><p>provide a general sense of how social resources varied </p><p>significantly across different racial–nativity strata; thus, </p><p>these variables may potentially attenuate the association </p><p>between access-to-care indicators and racial–nativity </p><p>status. Compared to CB Whites, racialized immigrants </p><p>were relatively younger (65–74 age group: 70.4% vs. </p><p>64.1%), earned ≥80k/year (44.9% vs. 36.9%), had </p><p>postsecondary education (60.3% vs. 53.5%), and spoke </p><p>nonofficial languages at home (37.8% vs. 0.2%). For be-</p><p>haviors, racialized immigrants were relatively healthier </p><p>with respect to not drinking in the past year (52.5% vs. </p><p>27.4%) and being nonsmoker (94.2% vs. 89.2%) than </p><p>their CB White peers.</p><p>The prevalence of multimorbidity was 29.6% and </p><p>around 82% of the entire sample had at least one </p><p>chronic condition. The weighted prevalence of 11 specific </p><p>chronic conditions stratified by race–nativity status was </p><p>tested by chi-square statistics (Supplementary Material </p><p>1), and most disparities were statistically significant (p </p><p>< .05), except for stroke (p  =  .411).

In addition, ra-</p><p>cialized immigrants had the highest rate of poor/fair </p><p>self-rated health (17.7%) but the lowest rate of having </p><p>obesity (10.2%). For access-to-care indicators, racial-</p><p>ized immigrants were at greater risk of lacking a usual </p><p>source of care compared with CB Whites (8.2% vs. 6%, </p><p>p < .05).

The association between racialized im-</p><p>migrant status and multimorbidity was robust even after </p><p>controlling for the full set of adverse social determinants </p><p>of health including the independent effect of lower house-</p><p>hold income (AOR’s range: 1.29–1.30), lowest education </p><p>bracket (< secondary school, AOR = 1.35, 99% CI: 1.18–</p><p>1.53), home renter status (AOR  =  1.27, 99% CI: 1.11–</p><p>1.46), weak sense of community belonging (AOR = 1.33, </p><p>99% CI: 1.18–1.49), and physical inactivity (AOR = 1.30, </p><p>99% CI: 1.18–1.43).</p><p>Interestingly, </p><p>for </p><p>provider-side </p><p>enabling </p><p>factors, </p><p>multimorbidity was adversely linked to the walk-in clinic </p><p>as a usual source of care (AOR  =  0.69, 99% CI: 0.60–</p><p>0.79), having only one regular HCP (AOR = 0.33, 99% </p><p>CI: 0.30–0.37), and lacking a regular HCP (AOR = 0.14, </p><p>99% CI: 0.11–0.18), possibly because receiving diagnoses </p><p>of multiple chronic illnesses required well-coordinated care </p><p>for older adults who were at risk of having underlying con-</p><p>ditions. Compared with CB Whites, racialized older immi-</p><p>grants had 21% greater odds of poor/fair self-rated health </p><p>(AOR = 1.21, 99% CI: 1.01–1.45) but were 73% less likely </p><p>to have obesity based on self-reported height and weight </p><p>(AOR  =  0.27, 99% CI: 0.23–0.32), whereas the level of </p><p>perceived life stress did not differ across four racial nativity </p><p>groups (p > .05).</p><p>RQ2: Disparities in USOC and Care Coordination</p><p>Figure 1B indicates the results of multivariable logistic </p><p>regression for USOC (full statistics, see Supplementary </p><p>Material 5). As shown in Figure 1B, when the base choice </p><p>was having a USOC, racialized older immigrants had 41% </p><p>greater odds of lacking a USOC (AOR  =  1.41, 99% CI </p><p>1.07–1.84), compared with CB Whites, even controlling </p><p>for significant access barriers, such as lower educational </p><p>attainment (AOR = 1.47, 99% CI: 1.21–1.80) and weak </p><p>community belongingness (AOR  =  1.48, 99% CI: 1.23–</p><p>1.77). However, when the base choice was doctor’s office, </p><p>immigrants, both non-Whites and Whites alike, were less </p><p>likely to use nonprimary care sites over a doctor’s office </p><p>as the USOC, including hospital outpatient clinic (AOR’s: </p><p>0.31, p < .001) and hospital emergency room (ER; AOR’s </p><p>range: 0.45–0.73, p < .001) in comparison to CB Whites. </p><p>This suggests that, among respondents who secured a </p><p>USOC, CB Whites tended to use hospital-based services </p><p>over physician’s office more than immigrant populations. </p><p>FB populations, both non-Whites and Whites alike, were </p><p>less likely to use community health centers over a doctor’s </p><p>office as the USOC than CB Whites (AOR’s range: 0.62–</p><p>0.76, p < .01). The preferential use of a walk-in clinic over a </p><p>doctor’s office did not differ between racialized immigrants </p><p>and CB Whites (p = .449).</p><p>Apart from racial–nativity differences, social-class dis-</p><p>parities in the USOC under universal coverage in Canada still </p><p>exhibited (see Supplementary Material 5): Socioeconomic </p><p>disadvantaged older adults were more likely to use hospital-</p><p>based ambulatory care services, compared with their peers </p><p>with higher socioeconomic status. Notably, there was a </p><p>clear income gradient: With decreasing income, the odds of </p><p>using the hospital ER (AOR’s range: 0.39–2.03, p’s < .001) </p><p>and hospital outpatient clinic (AOR’s range: 1.82–2.66, p’s </p><p>< .001) over a doctor’s office as the USOC significantly in-</p><p>creased.

Not surpris-</p><p>ingly, the lack of a regular HCP was strongly linked to the </p><p>increased use of hospital outpatient clinics (AOR = 16.56, </p><p>99% CI: 10.18–26.92), hospital ERs (AOR = 9.02, 99% </p><p>CI: 6.19–13.15), walk-in clinics (AOR = 15.54, 99% CI: </p><p>11.40–21.17), and community health centers (AOR = 5.61, </p><p>99% CI: 3.60–8.75) over doctor’s office as the USOC.</p><p>Figure 1C reveals the fully AORs for access to a reg-</p><p>ular HCP and care coordination (for full statistics, see </p><p>Supplementary Material 6). When the base choice was </p><p>having a regular HCP, racialized immigrants did not </p><p>differ in its access, compared with CB Whites (p = .152). </p><p>However, when the base choice was having two or more </p><p>regular HCPs with excellent-level care coordination, racial-</p><p>ized immigrants were more likely to have only one HCP </p><p>(AOR = 1.56, 99% CI: 1.32–1.86) or have two or more </p><p>HCPs with good-level care coordination (AOR  =  1.47, </p><p>99% CI: 1.16–1.87), relative to CB Whites. There was no </p><p>significant difference in the likelihood of having two or </p><p>more HCPs with poor/fair versus excellent-level care co-</p><p>ordination across four racial nativity groups (p’s > .05). </p><p>Interestingly, those who reported poor/fair self-rated health </p><p>(AOR  =  0.57, 99% CI: 0.51–0.63) and multimorbidity </p><p>(AOR = 0.33, 99% CI: 0.30–0.37) were less likely to have </p><p>only one regular HCP. This suggests that having only one </p><p>regular HCP did not necessarily reflect poor quality of care </p><p>for older adults; instead, it may indicate a healthier profile </p><p>of patients with less complicated health needs that did not </p><p>require referral to specialists and other HCPs.</p><p>RQ3: Disparities in SUN</p><p>Figure 1D shows the fully adjusted odds ratios of three di-</p><p>mensions of SUN (i.e., perception, reasons, and subtype) </p><p>by racial–nativity status and covariates (full statistics, see </p><p>310 </p><p>Journals of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES, 2023, Vol. 78, No. 2</p><p>Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article/78/2/302/6679535 by Haifa University user on 19 March 2023</p><p>Supplementary Material 7).

Notably, compared with CB Whites, racialized </p><p>immigrants had 81% higher odds (AOR = 1.81, 99% CI: </p><p>1.05–3.10) of the SUN for chronic care, which was a major </p><p>source (39.9%) of SUN among general older Canadians. </p><p>White immigrants reported greater odds of affordability </p><p>barriers (AOR = 3.35, 99% CI: 1.86–6.02) but lower odds </p><p>of availability barriers (AOR = 0.64, 99% CI: 0.42–0.96); </p><p>and they eventually shared a comparable pattern of SUN </p><p>perception relative to CB Whites (p = .707).</p><p>A sensitivity test was conducted to examine the extent </p><p>to which controlling for confounders could alter the key </p><p>relationship of interest, given that the association between </p><p>racial–nativity status and SUN perception was border-</p><p>line insignificant (p = .052) at the bivariate level but came </p><p>through at the multivariable regression analysis (p = .007). </p><p>The sensitivity test of SUN perception was performed in </p><p>six separate models, with the full model additionally con-</p><p>trolling for the cluster of specific chronic conditions and </p><p>medication use (see Supplementary Material 8).

The crude and adjusted odds </p><p>ratios were further examined to unveil nuanced differences </p><p>and potential mechanisms before and after adjustments. In </p><p>the crude model (Model A), racialized immigrants initially </p><p>had 36% higher odds of SUN perception (OR = 1.36, 99% </p><p>CI: 1.01–1.83) compared with CB Whites. After full adjust-</p><p>ment (Model E), racialized immigrants’ odds of SUN were </p><p>even 66% higher than CB Whites (AOR = 1.66, 99% CI: </p><p>1.15–2.40), suggesting that SUN disparities experienced by </p><p>racial immigrants were synergistically escalated by known </p><p>cofounders (i.e., strengthened the associations) and there </p><p>were unexplained causes of SUN stemming from the joint </p><p>impact of racialization and immigration.</p><p>More specifically, when further adding the cluster of </p><p>chronic conditions and medication use (see Model B), the </p><p>racial–nativity gap of SUN perception was enlarged from </p><p>the odds of 1.36–1.73 (99% CI: 1.28–2.34). This esti-</p><p>mate was substantially increased by the inclusion of five </p><p>chronic conditions (i.e., asthma [AOR  =  1.48], arthritis </p><p>[AOR = 1.89], high blood cholesterol [AOR = 1.43], mood </p><p>disorders [AOR = 1.75], and taking insulin to control di-</p><p>abetes [AOR = 1.80]) that were independently associated </p><p>with elevated odds of SUN. Notably, racialized immigrants </p><p>had the highest prevalence of high blood cholesterol, </p><p>asthma, and diabetes among all racial–nativity groups. </p><p>This suggests that underlying chronic conditions could not </p><p>explain racialized immigrants’ vulnerability of SUN per-</p><p>ception, even though they were more susceptible to certain </p><p>Figure 2.

The findings reveal </p><p>that, compared with CB Whites, racialized immigrants’ dis-</p><p>advantage in certain chronic illnesses and access-to-care </p><p>indicators could not explain racialized immigrants’ vulner-</p><p>ability to higher SUN perception. Alternatively, racialized </p><p>immigrants’ excess SUN perception was driven by their in-</p><p>creased exposure to affordability barriers, acceptability bar-</p><p>riers and possible undertreatment of physician-diagnosed </p><p>chronic physical disease. The overall finding that health </p><p>disparities between CB Whites and racialized immigrants </p><p>are larger once confounders are adjusted for is a crucial ob-</p><p>servation. As indicated in the descriptive profiles, racialized </p><p>migrants were somehow advantaged than CB Whites on </p><p>some of these sociodemographics in later life—they tend to </p><p>report higher income, higher educational level, be in mar-</p><p>ital status and have healthier lifestyles—and although these </p><p>312 </p><p>Journals of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES, 2023, Vol. 78, No. 2</p><p>Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article/78/2/302/6679535 by Haifa University user on 19 March 2023</p><p>relative advantages were accounted for in the multivariable </p><p>models, the racial–nativity gaps in health and health care </p><p>needs were further enlarged, suggesting that there are other </p><p>more fundamental causes (e.g., systemic discrimination, </p><p>racism, nativism) in shaping the vulnerability for racialized </p><p>immigrants at old age (Krieger, 1999, 2014).</p><p>Inequities in Need: Chronic Disease </p><p>Multimorbidity</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess </p><p>the joint impact of race and nativity on multimorbidity prev-</p><p>alence among older adults in Canada. The multimorbidity </p><p>disadvantage observed in this study challenges previous re-</p><p>search that may overgeneralize the “monolithic healthy im-</p><p>migrant phenomenon” to racialized immigrants in later life. </p><p>On the contrary, prior Canadian immigrant research reported </p><p>lower odds of multimorbidity among immigrants (Geda </p><p>et al., 2021; Mondor et al., 2018) or no nativity disparities </p><p>(McDonald & Kennedy, 2004; Newbold, K.  B. & Filice, </p><p>2006), although their chronic illness prevalence increased </p><p>upon arrival (Newbold, B., 2005). One explanation of mixed </p><p>findings is that previous studies typically homogenized immi-</p><p>grant populations across all races and life stages as a whole, </p><p>whereas this study distinguished racialized immigrants in </p><p>comparison to CB Whites with a specific focus on older age.</p><p>Through the racial equity lens, it would not be surprising </p><p>to observe White/non-White inequalities that are con-</p><p>sistent with racial health literature in Canada (Chiu et al., </p><p>2015; Ramraj et al., 2016; Veenstra & Patterson, 2016), </p><p>which found that racial minorities were more prone to res-</p><p>piratory and circulatory system disorders. For example, </p><p>studies suggest that long-term racialized immigrants have </p><p>doubled the odds of developing diabetes compared with CB </p><p>Whites (Adjei et al., 2020), and they also had earlier onset </p><p>of diabetes than immigrants from the United Kingdom </p><p>(Tenkorang, 2017). The finding of multimorbidity disad-</p><p>vantage among racialized immigrants was in sharp contrast </p><p>with their profiles of healthier behaviors (the lowest rate of </p><p>regular drinking, smoking, and obesity) than CB Whites in </p><p>this sample, suggesting that (un) lifestyle factors were very </p><p>unlikely to be the fundamental causes. Alternatively, our </p><p>study implies that, for racialized immigrants, any FB health </p><p>advantage may be offset by cumulative exposure to various </p><p>societal stressors, such as racism, xenophobia, and unequal </p><p>life chances in the postmigration period (Brown, 2018; </p><p>Kobayashi & Prus, 2012; Lin, 2022b), that would lead to </p><p>the accumulation of chronic conditions at later life stages </p><p>(Bailey et al., 2017).</p><p>Inequities in Care: Usual Source of Care and Care </p><p>Coordination</p><p>This study represents one of the first attempts to quantify </p><p>racial–nativity disparities in USOC and care coordination </p><p>between HCP for older Canadians. Racial segregation in </p><p>USOC has been well documented in the American health </p><p>care system (Arnett et al., 2016; Corbie-Smith et al., 2002; </p><p>Gaskin et al., 2007), whereby racial minority had a lower </p><p>propensity to use a physician’s office as USOC and more </p><p>likely to seek immediate care from ERs, hospital outpatient </p><p>departments, community health centers or to lack a USOC. </p><p>The current study did not replicate most American evi-</p><p>dence, with the exception that racialized immigrants tended </p><p>to lack a USOC than CB Whites. Moreover, contrary to </p><p>the expectation, immigrants, irrespective of race, were even </p><p>less likely to use hospital-based ambulatory care over a </p><p>doctor’s office as the USOC than CB Whites. There was no </p><p>significant racial–nativity difference in receiving poor/fair-</p><p>coordinated care from usual providers. These results may </p><p>collectively suggest that, under a universal health system </p><p>in Canada, racial–nativity inequities in access to care are </p><p>much less salient than in the United States (Lasser et al., </p><p>2006; Siddiqi et al., 2016). However, the concerning finding </p><p>that poor people are more likely to use ER over doctor’s </p><p>office as USOC coincides with prior observed inequities in </p><p>ER utilization in Canada (Ouimet et al., 2015).</p><p>Inequities in Unmet Need: Barriers and </p><p>Undertreatment of Chronic Illness</p><p>The robust association between racialized immigrants and </p><p>higher perceptions of SUN in later life had not been re-</p><p>ported elsewhere. Previous research found that immigrants, </p><p>in general, had a lower rate of SUN than nonimmigrants </p><p>and established immigrants (>15  years) shared a similar </p><p>prevalence of SUN in Canada (Wu et al., 2005). In a lon-</p><p>gitudinal study, racialized female immigrants even reported </p><p>less SUN than non-immigrants over 12 years (Setia et al., </p><p>2011). However, the current study did not support any of </p><p>these patterns, possibly owing to the focus on older popu-</p><p>lations whereas samples in prior research were mostly </p><p>working-age adults and racialized immigrants, if examined, </p><p>were significantly younger than their White peers. Instead, </p><p>a central finding of this study reveals that older racialized </p><p>immigrants had higher odds of SUN than CB Whites, a </p><p>pattern that could not be explained by health needs and </p><p>access-to-care factors but was attributable to barriers re-</p><p>lated to service acceptability and affordability.</p><p>Notably, almost half of such acceptability problems for </p><p>racialized immigrants (43.8%) were due to unmeasured </p><p>reasons (i.e., “other”—the leading source of disparities vs. </p><p>22.6% of CB Whites) beyond attitudinal concerns (e.g., </p><p>“decided not to seek care”). This may reflect, in part, the </p><p>fact that immigrant and racialized communities often en-</p><p>counter discrimination within Westernized Canadian health </p><p>care settings (Edge & Newbold, 2013; Johnson et al., 2004; </p><p>Lin, 2021), including biased treatment, racial stereotyping </p><p>of medical noncompliance, cross-cultural misapprehen-</p><p>sions (Chowdhury et al., 2021), all of which could give rise </p><p>to acceptability barriers resulting in racialized immigrants’ </p><p>Journals of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES, 2023, Vol. 78, No. 2 </p><p>313</p><p>Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article/78/2/302/6679535 by Haifa University user on 19 March 2023</p><p>delayed access to care. Considering that the SUN percep-</p><p>tion captured almost all types of health services, the excess </p><p>affordability barrier experienced by racialized immigrants </p><p>may stem from care services that were not covered by the </p><p>publicly funded health insurance (Martin et al., 2018), such </p><p>as dental care (Sano & Antabe, 2021).</p><p>It should be noted that the SUN gap (i.e., the magni-</p><p>tude of estimate) between racialized immigrants and CB </p><p>Whites was substantially accentuated after the block of </p><p>specific chronic conditions and medication use was con-</p><p>sidered, suggesting that multimorbidity should be an im-</p><p>portant factor to contextualize this inequality issue. It is </p><p>likely that certain chronic conditions—which were not di-</p><p>rectly associated with SUN (primarily driven by the dom-</p><p>inant CB White populations) but significantly correlated </p><p>with racial minority immigrants—such as greater cardio-</p><p>vascular burden of hypertension and diabetes may lead to </p><p>a larger racial–nativity discrepancy in the SUN perception. </p><p>Most importantly, this compounding effect was more pro-</p><p>nounced when the SUN perception was further restricted to </p><p>treatment for chronic physical conditions in the subsample </p><p>analysis of chronically ill patients, in which racialized im-</p><p>migrants almost have triple the likelihood of unmet needs </p><p>for chronic care than CB Whites. Such inequities in chronic </p><p>illness treatment pose a severe threat to self-management </p><p>practice (e.g., medication, monitoring, and testing) for ra-</p><p>cialized immigrant older adults, especially when SUN was </p><p>linked to future health decline as observed in longitudinal </p><p>research (Gibson et al., 2019).</p><p>Another key contribution is the finding of poor/fair care </p><p>coordination’s adverse association with SUN perception </p><p>among older adults with complex care needs, suggesting </p><p>that fragmentation of Canada’s health care system could </p><p>compromise universal coverage’s goal in achieving eq-</p><p>uitable care (Bodenheimer, 2008). It calls for redesigning </p><p>primary care infrastructures that could address insufficient </p><p>coordination for patients seen by multiple and/or interdis-</p><p>ciplinary care clinicians across different settings (Schoen </p><p>et al., 2009). Many promising models of integrated team-</p><p>based geriatric care have shown to be effective to improve </p><p>the continuity of care for older adults living with frailty, </p><p>such as the WHO’s Innovative Care for Chronic Conditions </p><p>framework (Epping-Jordan et al., 2004), and family health </p><p>team model (Rosser et al., 2011). Evidence has found that </p><p>diabetic patients in primary care networks (PCNs) were </p><p>more likely to be referred to an ophthalmologist/optome-</p><p>trist and had better glycemic control than patients outside </p><p>of the PCNs (Manns et al., 2012). Lastly, the intersection </p><p>of race–migration nexus and care coordination, as found </p><p>in CART analysis, indicates that the racial–nativity gap in </p><p>SUN perception was still evident even within a relatively </p><p>advantaged subgroup (i.e., those who received good coor-</p><p>dination between two or more health care providers and </p><p>having access to a regular providers). This finding suggests </p><p>that even under an integrated health care system, presum-</p><p>ably with well-coordinated services, is far from adequately </p><p>narrowing the racial–nativity gap in SUN; thus, targeted </p><p>policy efforts should be directed to deliver culturally sensi-</p><p>tive geriatric care.</p><p>Strength and Limitations</p><p>This study has several strengths, including its large sample </p><p>size, its ability to simultaneously examine social patterning </p><p>of health and health care inequalities, its pragmatic cate-</p><p>gorization of the race-immigration nexus, and its attention </p><p>to the clustering of chronic medical conditions. However, </p><p>several methodological biases limited the generalizability </p><p>of this study. First, this study relied on self-reported survey </p><p>data and therefore is susceptible to recall bias. Second, </p><p>many older adults with medical conditions may have not </p><p>been diagnosed or survey nonrespondents tend to have </p><p>significantly higher rates of chronic conditions; thus, these </p><p>under-reporting scenarios would possibly result in an un-</p><p>derestimate of multimorbidity prevalence. Third, due to </p><p>the small sample size and the resultant statistical power </p><p>issue, the estimates for CB non-Whites (N = 175) contain </p><p>large variance and should be interpreted with cautions. In </p><p>addition, due to the constraint of using PUMF, the meas-</p><p>urements related to heterogeneity and intragroup differ-</p><p>ences of racialized immigrant communities could not be </p><p>examined (Lin et al., 2020), such as admission class (e.g., </p><p>refugee status), country of origin, and ethnic composition. </p><p>Furthermore, some covariates (e.g., community belonging-</p><p>ness) controlled in the model may be potential mediators, </p><p>future research should employ path analysis to investi-</p><p>gate the mechanisms that explain how the race–nativity </p><p>nexus could lead to health inequity and health care ineq-</p><p>uity under Canadian “universal” health system. Lastly, the </p><p>CCHS data lack information about more complex reasons </p><p>for SUN, such as discrimination during previous health </p><p>care interactions (Gaskin et al., 2007), medical mistrust </p><p>(Arnett et al., 2016), and so forth, which may help to ex-</p><p>plain health care inequities for racialized populations.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Overall, this population-based study of pooled cross-sec-</p><p>tional data has demonstrated racial–nativity inequities </p><p>in the prevalence of multimorbidity and unmet needs for </p><p>chronic care among older Canadians, inequities that dis-</p><p>proportionately affect racialized immigrants despite a </p><p>universal health system. At the policy level, the findings </p><p>underscore that both race and nativity, as intertwined so-</p><p>cial determinants of health, still play a fundamental role in </p><p>shaping the distribution of health-enhancing resources. At </p><p>the practice level, the findings recommend health and social </p><p>care professionals bridge the service gap by effective care </p><p>management and coordination.
