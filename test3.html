Growth, devel-</p><p>opment, reproduction, blood pressure, concentrations </p><p>of ions and other substances in blood, and even behav-</p><p>ior are all regulated by the endocrine system. Endocrine </p><p>physiology involves the secretion of hormones and </p><p>their subsequent actions on target tissues.</p><p>A hormone is a chemical substance that is classi-</p><p>fied as a peptide, a steroid, or an amine. Hormones </p><p>are secreted into the circulation in small amounts </p><p>and delivered to target tissues, where they produce </p><p>physiologic responses. Hormones are synthesized and </p><p>secreted by endocrine cells usually found in endocrine </p><p>glands. Table 9.1 is a list of hormones and their </p><p>abbreviations, which are used throughout Chapters 9  </p><p>and 10.</p><p>The classic endocrine glands are the hypothalamus, </p><p>anterior and posterior lobes of the pituitary, thyroid, </p><p>parathyroid, adrenal cortex, adrenal medulla, gonads, </p><p>placenta, and pancreas. The kidney also is considered </p><p>to be an endocrine gland, and endocrine cells are found </p><p>throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Table 9.2 sum-</p><p>marizes the major hormones, their glands of origin, </p><p>their chemical nature, and their major actions. Its </p><p>companion, Figure 9.1, is a pictorial summary of the </p><p>endocrine glands and their hormonal secretions.</p><p>HORMONE SYNTHESIS</p><p>Hormones are categorized in one of three classes: peptides and proteins, steroids, or </p><p>amines. Each class differs in its biosynthetic pathway: Peptide and protein hormones </p><p>are synthesized from amino acids; steroid hormones are derivatives of cholesterol; and </p><p>amine hormones are derivatives of tyrosine.</p><p>Peptide and Protein Hormone Synthesis</p><p>Most hormones are peptide or protein in nature. The biosynthetic pathways are familiar </p><p>from biochemistry. The primary amino acid sequence of the peptide is dictated by a </p><p>specific messenger ribonucleotide (mRNA), which has been transcribed from the gene </p><p>for that hormone.

Some of the </p><p>“other” peptide sequences in the prohormone are </p><p>necessary for proper folding of the hormone (e.g., </p><p>formation of intramolecular linkages).</p><p>4. The prohormone is transferred to the Golgi appa-</p><p>ratus, where it is packaged in secretory vesicles. In</p><p>the secretory vesicles, proteolytic enzymes cleave</p><p>peptide sequences from the prohormone to produce</p><p>the final hormone. Other functions of the Golgi</p><p>apparatus include glycosylation and phosphoryla-</p><p>tion of the hormone.</p><p>5. The final hormone is stored in secretory vesicles</p><p>until the endocrine cell is stimulated. For example,</p><p>parathyroid hormone (PTH) is synthesized and stored </p><p>in vesicles in the chief cells of the parathyroid gland.</p><p>The stimulus for secretion of PTH is low-extracellular</p><p>calcium (Ca2+) concentration. When sensors on the</p><p>parathyroid gland detect a low-extracellular Ca2+</p><p>concentration, the secretory vesicles are translocated</p><p>to the cell membrane, where they extrude PTH into</p><p>the blood by exocytosis. The other constituents of</p><p>Figure 9.2. The circled numbers in the figure correspond </p><p>to the following steps:</p><p>1. In the nucleus, the gene for the hormone is tran-</p><p>scribed into an mRNA. Generally, a single gene is</p><p>responsible for directing the primary structure of</p><p>each peptide hormone. (Because the genes for almost</p><p>all peptide hormones have been cloned, recombinant</p><p>DNA technology makes it possible to synthesize</p><p>human peptide hormones.)</p><p>2. The mRNA is transferred to the cytoplasm and trans-</p><p>lated on the ribosomes to the first protein product,</p><p>a preprohormone. Translation of the mRNA begins</p><p>with a signal peptide at the N terminus. Translation</p><p>ceases, and the signal peptide attaches to recep-</p><p>tors on the endoplasmic reticulum via “docking</p><p>proteins.” Translation then continues on the endo-</p><p>plasmic reticulum until the entire peptide sequence</p><p>is produced (i.e., the preprohormone).</p><p>3.

The biosynthetic pathway for catecholamines </p><p>is discussed in Chapter 1. The pathway for thyroid </p><p>hormones is discussed in this chapter.</p><p>REGULATION OF HORMONE </p><p>SECRETION</p><p>To maintain homeostasis, the secretion of hormones </p><p>must be turned on and off as needed. Adjustments </p><p>in secretory rates may be accomplished by neural </p><p>mechanisms or by feedback mechanisms. Neural </p><p>mechanisms are illustrated by the secretion of cat-</p><p>echolamines, where preganglionic sympathetic nerves </p><p>synapse on the adrenal medulla and, when stimulated, </p><p>cause secretion of catecholamines into the circulation. </p><p>Feedback mechanisms are more common than neural </p><p>mechanisms. The term “feedback” means that some </p><p>element of the physiologic response to a hormone </p><p>“feeds back,” either directly or indirectly, on the endo-</p><p>crine gland that secreted the hormone, changing its </p><p>secretion rate. Feedback can be negative or positive. </p><p>Negative feedback is the more important and common </p><p>mechanism for regulating hormone secretion; positive </p><p>feedback is rare.</p><p>Negative Feedback</p><p>The principles of negative feedback underlie the </p><p>homeostatic regulation of virtually all organ systems. </p><p>For example, in Chapter 4, negative feedback is dis-</p><p>cussed in the regulation of arterial blood pressure in </p><p>which small changes in blood pressure turn on, or </p><p>activate, mechanisms that will restore blood pressure </p><p>back to normal. A decrease in arterial blood pressure </p><p>is detected by baroreceptors, which activate coordi-</p><p>nated mechanisms that increase blood pressure. As </p><p>blood pressure returns to normal, a disturbance is no </p><p>longer sensed by the baroreceptors and those mecha-</p><p>nisms previously activated will be turned off. The </p><p>more sensitive the feedback mechanism, the smaller </p><p>the “excursions” of blood pressure above or below  </p><p>normal.</p><p>In endocrine systems, negative feedback means that </p><p>some feature of hormone action, directly or indirectly, </p><p>inhibits further secretion of the hormone. Negative </p><p>feedback loops are illustrated in Figure 9.3. For illustra-</p><p>tive purposes, the hypothalamus is shown in relation </p><p>to the anterior pituitary, which is shown in relation to </p><p>a peripheral endocrine gland. In the figure, the hypo-</p><p>thalamus secretes a releasing hormone, which stimu-</p><p>lates secretion of an anterior pituitary hormone. The </p><p>anterior pituitary hormone then acts on a peripheral </p><p>endocrine gland (e.g., the testis) to cause secretion of </p><p>the hormone (e.g., testosterone), which acts on target </p><p>the secretory vesicles, including copeptides and </p><p>cleavage enzymes, are extruded with PTH.</p><p>Steroid Hormone Synthesis</p><p>Steroid hormones are synthesized and secreted by </p><p>the adrenal cortex, gonads, corpus luteum, and pla-</p><p>centa. The steroid hormones are cortisol, aldosterone, </p><p>estradiol and estriol, progesterone, testosterone, and </p><p>1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. All steroid hormones </p><p>are derivatives of cholesterol, which is modified by </p><p>removal or addition of side chains, hydroxylation, or </p><p>aromatization of the steroid nucleus. The biosynthetic </p><p>pathways for the adrenocortical hormones and for </p><p>1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol are discussed in this </p><p>chapter. The pathways for the sex steroid hormones </p><p>are discussed in Chapter 10.</p><p>Amine Hormone Synthesis</p><p>The amine hormones are catecholamines (epinephrine, </p><p>norepinephrine, and dopamine) and thyroid hormones. </p><p>PEPTIDE HORMONE SYNTHESIS</p><p>DNA</p><p>mRNA</p><p>Nucleus</p><p>Hormone</p><p>Preprohormone</p><p>Ribosomes</p><p>Prohormone</p><p>Endoplasmic</p><p>reticulum</p><p>Golgi apparatus</p><p>Secretory</p><p>vesicles</p><p>1</p><p>2</p><p>3</p><p>4</p><p>5</p><p>Fig. 9.2 Steps involved in the synthesis of peptide hor-</p><p>mones.

Thus when blood </p><p>glucose concentration is high, insulin secretion from </p><p>the pancreas is turned on; insulin then acts on its </p><p>target tissues (liver, muscle, and adipose) to decrease </p><p>the blood glucose concentration back toward normal. </p><p>When the glucose concentration is sensed as being low </p><p>enough, insulin is no longer needed and its secretion </p><p>is turned off.</p><p>Positive Feedback</p><p>Positive feedback is uncommon. With positive feed-</p><p>back, some feature of hormone action causes more </p><p>secretion of the hormone (see Fig. 9.3). When compared </p><p>with negative feedback, which is self-limiting, positive </p><p>feedback is self-augmenting. Although rare in biologic </p><p>systems, when positive feedback does occur, it leads to </p><p>an explosive event.</p><p>A nonhormonal example of positive feedback is the </p><p>opening of nerve sodium (Na+) channels during the </p><p>upstroke of the action potential. Depolarization opens </p><p>tissues (e.g., skeletal muscle) to produce physiologic </p><p>actions. The hormones “feed back” on the anterior </p><p>pituitary and the hypothalamus to inhibit their hor-</p><p>monal secretions. Long-loop feedback means that the </p><p>hormone feeds back all the way to the hypothalamic-</p><p>pituitary axis. Short-loop feedback means that the </p><p>anterior pituitary hormone feeds back on the hypo-</p><p>thalamus to inhibit secretion of hypothalamic-releasing </p><p>hormone. Not shown in the figure is a third possibility </p><p>called ultrashort-loop feedback, in which the hypotha-</p><p>lamic hormone inhibits its own secretion (e.g., growth </p><p>hormone–releasing hormone [GHRH] inhibits GHRH </p><p>secretion).</p><p>The net result of any version of negative feedback is </p><p>that when hormone levels are judged (by their physi-</p><p>ologic actions) to be adequate or high, further secretion </p><p>of the hormone is inhibited. When hormone levels </p><p>are judged to be inadequate or low, secretion of the </p><p>hormone is stimulated.</p><p>There are other examples of negative feedback that </p><p>do not utilize the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.

This self-reinforcing process produces </p><p>the rapid, explosive upstroke.</p><p>In hormonal systems, the primary example of posi-</p><p>tive feedback is the effect of estrogen on the secretion </p><p>of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing </p><p>hormone (LH) by the anterior pituitary at the midpoint </p><p>of the menstrual cycle. During the follicular phase of </p><p>the menstrual cycle, the ovaries secrete estrogen, which </p><p>acts on the anterior pituitary to produce a rapid burst </p><p>of FSH and LH secretion. FSH and LH have two effects </p><p>on the ovaries: ovulation and stimulation of estrogen </p><p>secretion. Thus estrogen secreted from the ovaries acts </p><p>on the anterior pituitary to cause secretion of FSH </p><p>and LH, and these anterior pituitary hormones cause </p><p>more estrogen secretion. In this example, the explo-</p><p>sive event is the burst of FSH and LH that precedes  </p><p>ovulation.</p><p>A second example of hormonal positive feedback is </p><p>oxytocin. Dilation of the cervix causes the posterior </p><p>pituitary to secrete oxytocin. In turn, oxytocin stimu-</p><p>lates uterine contraction, which causes further dilation </p><p>of the cervix. In this example, the explosive event is </p><p>parturition, the delivery of the fetus.</p><p>REGULATION OF HORMONE </p><p>RECEPTORS</p><p>The previous section describes the mechanisms that </p><p>regulate circulating levels of hormones, usually by </p><p>negative feedback. Although circulating hormone levels </p><p>are important, they are not the only determinant of the </p><p>response of a target tissue. To respond, a target tissue </p><p>must possess specific receptors that recognize the </p><p>hormone. Those receptors are coupled to cellular </p><p>mechanisms that produce the physiologic response. </p><p>(The coupling mechanisms are discussed in the section </p><p>on mechanisms of hormone action.)</p><p>The responsiveness of a target tissue to a hormone </p><p>is expressed in the dose-response relationship in </p><p>which the magnitude of response is correlated with </p><p>hormone concentration. As the hormone concentration </p><p>increases, the response usually increases and then </p><p>levels off. Sensitivity is defined as the hormone con-</p><p>centration that produces 50% of the maximal response. </p><p>If more hormone is required to produce 50% of the </p><p>maximal response, then there has been a decrease in </p><p>sensitivity of the target tissue. If less hormone is </p><p>required, there has been an increase in sensitivity of </p><p>the target tissue.</p><p>The responsiveness or sensitivity of a target tissue </p><p>can be changed in one of two ways: by changing </p><p>the number of receptors or by changing the affinity </p><p>of the receptors for the hormone. The greater the </p><p>number of receptors for a hormone, the greater the </p><p>maximal response. The higher the affinity of the recep-</p><p>tor for the hormone, the greater the likelihood of a  </p><p>response.</p><p>A change in the number or affinity of receptors </p><p>is called down-regulation or up-regulation. Down-</p><p>regulation means that the number of receptors or the </p><p>affinity of the receptors for the hormone has decreased. </p><p>Up-regulation means that the number or the affinity </p><p>of the receptors has increased. Hormones may down-</p><p>regulate or up-regulate their own receptors in target </p><p>tissues and even may regulate receptors for other </p><p>hormones.</p><p>Down-Regulation</p><p>Down-regulation is a mechanism in which a hormone </p><p>decreases the number or affinity of its receptors in a </p><p>target tissue. Down-regulation may occur by decreasing </p><p>the synthesis of new receptors, by increasing the deg-</p><p>radation of existing receptors, or by inactivating recep-</p><p>tors. The purpose of down-regulation is to reduce the </p><p>sensitivity of the target tissue when hormone levels are </p><p>high for an extended period of time. As down-regulation </p><p>occurs, the response to hormone declines, although </p><p>hormone levels remain high. An example of down-</p><p>regulation is the effect of progesterone on its own </p><p>receptor in the uterus (see Chapter 10).</p><p>Down-regulation can also refer to a hormone’s effect </p><p>on receptors for other related hormones. This type of </p><p>down-regulation also is illustrated by progesterone. In </p><p>the uterus, progesterone down-regulates its own recep-</p><p>tor and down-regulates the receptors for estrogen. A </p><p>second example of this type of down-regulation is seen </p><p>in the thyroid system: Triiodothyronine, or T3, decreases </p><p>the sensitivity of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) </p><p>receptors in the anterior pituitary. The overall effect is </p><p>that chronically high levels of T3 reduce the overall </p><p>responsiveness of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid </p><p>axis.</p><p>Up-Regulation</p><p>Up-regulation of receptors is a mechanism in which  </p><p>a hormone increases the number or affinity of its  </p><p>receptors. Up-regulation may occur by increasing syn-</p><p>thesis of new receptors, decreasing degradation of </p><p>existing receptors, or activating receptors. For example, </p><p>prolactin increases the number of its receptors in the </p><p>breast, growth hormone increases the number of its </p><p>receptors in skeletal muscle and liver, and estrogen </p><p>increases the number of its receptors in the uterus.</p><p>A hormone also can up-regulate the receptors for </p><p>other hormones. For example, estrogen not only up-</p><p>regulates its own receptor in the uterus, but it also </p><p>up-regulates the receptors for LH in the ovaries.</p><p>402 • Physiology</p><p>At the molecular level, G proteins are heterotrimeric </p><p>proteins (i.e., they have three subunits). The three </p><p>subunits are designated alpha (α), beta (β), and gamma </p><p>(γ).

The steroid hormone diffuses across the cell mem-</p><p>brane and enters its target cell (Step 1), where it</p><p>binds to a specific receptor protein (Step 2) that is</p><p>located in either the cytosol (as shown in Fig. 9.8)</p><p>or nucleus. Steroid hormone receptors are mono-</p><p>meric phosphoproteins that are part of a gene</p><p>superfamily of intracellular receptors. Each receptor</p><p>has six domains (see Fig. 9.7). The steroid hormone</p><p>binds in the E domain located near the C terminus.</p><p>The central C domain is highly conserved among</p><p>different steroid hormone receptors, has two zinc</p><p>fingers, and is responsible for DNA binding. With</p><p>hormone bound, the receptor undergoes a confor-</p><p>mational change and the activated hormone-receptor</p><p>complex enters the nucleus of the target cell.</p><p>2. The hormone-receptor complex dimerizes and binds</p><p>(at its C domain) via the zinc fingers to specific</p><p>DNA sequences, called steroid-responsive elements</p><p>(SREs) located in the 5′ region of target genes</p><p>(Step 3).</p><p>3. The hormone-receptor complex has now become a</p><p>transcription factor that regulates the rate of tran-</p><p>scription of that gene (Step 4). New messenger RNA</p><p>(mRNA) is transcribed (Step 5), leaves the nucleus</p><p>(Step 6), and is translated to new proteins (Step 7)</p><p>that have specific physiologic actions (Step 8). The</p><p>nature of the new proteins is specific to the hormone</p><p>and accounts for the specificity of the hormone’s</p><p>actions.

In this </p><p>monomeric type, binding of ligand to the extracel-</p><p>lular domain results in dimerization of the receptor, </p><p>activation of intrinsic tyrosine kinase, and phos-</p><p>phorylation of tyrosine moieties on itself and other </p><p>proteins, leading to its physiologic actions.</p><p>Another type of receptor tyrosine kinase is already </p><p>a dimer (e.g., insulin and insulin-like growth </p><p>factor [IGF] receptors, see Fig. 9.6B). In this dimeric </p><p>type, binding of the ligand (e.g., insulin) activates </p><p>intrinsic tyrosine kinase and leads to phosphoryla-</p><p>tion of itself and other proteins and ultimately the </p><p>hormone’s physiologic actions. The mechanism of </p><p>the insulin receptor is also discussed later in the </p><p>chapter.</p><p>♦ Tyrosine kinase–associated receptors (e.g., growth</p><p>hormone receptors, see Fig. 9.6C) also have an</p><p>extracellular domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane</p><p>domain, and an intracellular domain. However,</p><p>unlike the receptor tyrosine kinases, the intracellular</p><p>domain does not have tyrosine kinase activity but</p><p>is noncovalently “associated” with tyrosine kinase</p><p>such as those in the Janus kinase family (JAK, Janus</p><p>family of receptor-associated tyrosine kinase, or “just</p><p>another kinase”). Hormone binds to the extracellular</p><p>domain, leading to receptor dimerization and activa-</p><p>tion of tyrosine kinase in the associated protein (e.g.,</p><p>JAK). The associated tyrosine kinase phosphorylates</p><p>tyrosine moieties on itself, the hormone receptor,</p><p>and other proteins. Downstream targets of JAK</p><p>include members of the STAT (signal transducers</p><p>and activators of transcription) family, which cause</p><p>transcription of mRNAs and ultimately new proteins</p><p>involved in the hormone’s physiologic actions.</p><p>Steroid and Thyroid Hormone Mechanism</p><p>Steroid hormones and thyroid hormones have the same </p><p>mechanism of action.

Venous </p><p>blood from the posterior pituitary enters the systemic </p><p>circulation, which delivers the hormones to their target </p><p>tissues.</p><p>In summary, the relationship between the hypothala-</p><p>mus and the posterior pituitary is straightforward—a </p><p>hormone-secreting neuron has its cell body in the </p><p>hypothalamus and its axons in the posterior lobe of the </p><p>pituitary.</p><p>Relationship of the Hypothalamus </p><p>to the Anterior Pituitary</p><p>The anterior lobe of the pituitary gland is derived from </p><p>primitive foregut. Unlike the posterior lobe, which is </p><p>neural tissue, the anterior lobe is primarily a collection </p><p>of endocrine cells. The anterior pituitary secretes six </p><p>peptide hormones: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), </p><p>FSH, LH, growth hormone, prolactin, and adrenocorti-</p><p>cotropic hormone (ACTH).</p><p>The nature of the relationship between the hypo-</p><p>thalamus and the anterior pituitary is both neural and </p><p>endocrine (in contrast to the posterior lobe, which is </p><p>only neural). The hypothalamus and anterior pituitary </p><p>are linked directly by the hypothalamic-hypophysial </p><p>portal blood vessels, which provide most of the blood </p><p>supply of the anterior lobe.</p><p>There are both long and short hypophysial portal </p><p>vessels, which are distinguished as follows: Arterial </p><p>blood is delivered to the hypothalamus via the superior </p><p>hypophysial arteries, which distribute the blood in a </p><p>capillary network in the median eminence, called the </p><p>primary capillary plexuses. These primary capillary </p><p>plexuses converge to form the long hypophysial portal </p><p>vessels, which travel down the infundibulum to deliver </p><p>hypothalamic venous blood to the anterior lobe of  </p><p>the pituitary. A parallel capillary plexus forms from the </p><p>inferior hypophysial arteries in the lower portion of the </p><p>infundibular stem. These capillaries converge to form </p><p>the short hypophysial portal vessels, which deliver </p><p>blood to the anterior lobe of the pituitary. In summary, </p><p>the blood supply of the anterior pituitary differs from </p><p>that of other organs: Most of its blood supply is venous </p><p>blood from the hypothalamus, supplied by the long and </p><p>short hypophysial portal vessels.</p><p>There are two important physiologic implications of </p><p>the portal blood supply to the anterior lobe of the </p><p>pituitary: (1) The hypothalamic hormones can be </p><p>delivered to the anterior pituitary directly and in high </p><p>concentration, and (2) the hypothalamic hormones do </p><p>not appear in the systemic circulation in high concen-</p><p>trations. The cells of the anterior pituitary, therefore, </p><p>are the only cells in the body to receive high concentra-</p><p>tions of the hypothalamic hormones.</p><p>410 • Physiology</p><p>α and β subunits begins in the endoplasmic reticulum </p><p>and continues in the Golgi apparatus.

Thus HCG is a glycoprotein with the identical </p><p>α chain and its own β chain, which confers its biologic </p><p>specificity.</p><p>ACTH Family</p><p>The ACTH family is derived from a single precursor, </p><p>pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). The ACTH family </p><p>includes ACTH, γ- and β-lipotropin, β-endorphin, and </p><p>melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH). ACTH is the </p><p>only hormone in this family with well-established </p><p>physiologic actions in humans. MSH is involved in </p><p>pigmentation in lower vertebrates but has some activity </p><p>in humans. β-Endorphin is an endogenous opiate.</p><p>The preprohormone for this group, prepro-</p><p>opiomelanocortin, is transcribed from a single gene. </p><p>The signal peptide is cleaved in the endoplasmic reticu-</p><p>lum, yielding POMC, the precursor to the ACTH family. </p><p>Endopeptidases then hydrolyze peptide bonds in POMC </p><p>and intermediates to produce the members of the ACTH </p><p>family (Fig. 9.10). The anterior pituitary in humans </p><p>produces mainly ACTH, γ-lipotropin, and β-endorphin.</p><p>It is noteworthy that MSH activity is found in POMC </p><p>and in several of its products: The “fragment,” which is </p><p>left over from hydrolysis of the ACTH intermediate, con-</p><p>tains γ-MSH; ACTH contains α-MSH; and γ-lipotropin </p><p>secrete TSH), there is exocytosis of the secretory gran-</p><p>ules; the anterior pituitary hormone (e.g., TSH) enters </p><p>capillary blood and is delivered by the systemic circula-</p><p>tion to the target tissue (e.g., thyroid gland).</p><p>The hormones of the anterior lobe are organized in </p><p>“families” according to their structural and functional </p><p>homology. TSH, FSH, and LH are structurally related </p><p>and constitute one family, ACTH is part of a second </p><p>family, and growth hormone and prolactin constitute a </p><p>third family.</p><p>TSH, FSH, LH, and ACTH are discussed briefly in </p><p>this section and later in the chapter in the context of </p><p>their actions.

Hypoglycemia (a </p><p>decrease in blood glucose concentration) and starvation </p><p>are potent stimuli for growth hormone secretion. Other </p><p>stimuli for secretion are exercise and various forms </p><p>of stress including trauma, fever, and anesthesia. The </p><p>highest rates of growth hormone secretion occur during </p><p>puberty, and the lowest rates occur in senescence.</p><p>Regulation of growth hormone secretion is illustrated </p><p>in Figure 9.11, which shows the relationship between </p><p>the hypothalamus, the anterior lobe of the pituitary, </p><p>and the target tissues for growth hormone. Secretion of </p><p>growth hormone by the anterior pituitary is controlled </p><p>by two pathways from the hypothalamus, one stimula-</p><p>tory (GHRH) and the other inhibitory (somatostatin, </p><p>also known as somatotropin release–inhibiting factor </p><p>[SRIF]).</p><p>♦ GHRH acts directly on somatotrophs of the ante-</p><p>rior pituitary to induce transcription of the growth</p><p>hormone gene and thereby to stimulate both synthe-</p><p>sis and secretion of growth hormone. In initiating</p><p>its action on the somatotroph, GHRH binds to a</p><p>membrane receptor, which is coupled through a Gs</p><p>protein to both adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase</p><p>C. Thus GHRH stimulates growth hormone secre-</p><p>tion by utilizing both cAMP and IP3/Ca2+ as second</p><p>messengers.</p><p>♦ Somatostatin </p><p>(somatotropin </p><p>release–inhibiting</p><p>hormone [SRIF]) is also secreted by the hypothala-</p><p>mus and acts on the somatotrophs to inhibit growth</p><p>hormone secretion. Somatostatin inhibits growth</p><p>hormone secretion by blocking the action of GHRH</p><p>on the somatotroph. Somatostatin binds to its own</p><p>membrane receptor, which is coupled to adenylyl</p><p>cyclase by a Gi protein, inhibiting the generation of</p><p>cAMP and decreasing growth hormone secretion.</p><p>contains β-MSH. These MSH-containing fragments </p><p>can cause skin pigmentation in humans if their blood </p><p>levels are increased. For example, in Addison disease </p><p>(primary adrenal insufficiency), POMC and ACTH levels </p><p>are increased by negative feedback. Because POMC and </p><p>ACTH contain MSH activity, skin pigmentation is a </p><p>symptom of this disorder.</p><p>Growth Hormone</p><p>Growth hormone is secreted throughout life. It is the </p><p>single most important hormone for normal growth to </p><p>adult stature. Considering the broad nature of this task </p><p>(growth), it is not surprising that growth hormone has </p><p>profound effects on protein, carbohydrate, and fat </p><p>metabolism.</p><p>Chemistry of Growth Hormone</p><p>Growth hormone is synthesized in the somatotrophs </p><p>of the anterior lobe of the pituitary and also is called </p><p>somatotropin or somatotropic hormone. Human growth </p><p>hormone contains 191 amino acids in a straight-chain </p><p>polypeptide with 2 internal disulfide bridges. The </p><p>gene for growth hormone is a member of a family </p><p>of genes for related peptides, prolactin and human </p><p>placental lactogen. The synthesis of growth hormone </p><p>is stimulated by GHRH, its hypothalamic-releasing </p><p>hormone.</p><p>Human growth hormone is structurally similar to </p><p>prolactin, which is synthesized by lactotrophs in the </p><p>anterior lobe, and to human placental lactogen, which </p><p>is synthesized in the placenta. Prolactin, a 198–amino </p><p>acid straight-chain polypeptide with 3 disulfide bridges, </p><p>has 75% homology with growth hormone. Human pla-</p><p>cental lactogen, a 191–amino acid straight-chain poly-</p><p>peptide with 2 disulfide bridges, has 80% homology.</p><p>Regulation of Growth Hormone Secretion</p><p>Growth hormone is secreted in a pulsatile pattern, with </p><p>bursts of secretion occurring approximately every 2 </p><p>hours. The largest secretory burst occurs within 1 hour </p><p>of falling asleep (during sleep stages III and IV). The </p><p>bursting pattern, in terms of both frequency and mag-</p><p>nitude, is affected by several agents that alter the overall </p><p>level of growth hormone secretion (Table 9.4).</p><p>Growth hormone secretory rates are not constant </p><p>over a lifetime. The rate of secretion increases steadily </p><p>from birth into early childhood. During childhood, </p><p>secretion remains relatively stable. At puberty, there is </p><p>an enormous secretory burst, induced in females by </p><p>estrogen and in males by testosterone. The high pubertal </p><p>levels of growth hormone are associated with both </p><p>increased frequency and increased magnitude of the </p><p>secretory pulses and are responsible for the growth </p><p>spurt of puberty. After puberty, the rate of growth </p><p>hormone secretion declines to a stable level.

The growth-promoting effects of </p><p>growth hormone are mediated largely through produc-</p><p>tion of somatomedins.</p><p>The actions of growth hormone are described as </p><p>follows:</p><p>♦ Diabetogenic </p><p>or </p><p>anti-insulin </p><p>effect. </p><p>Growth</p><p>hormone causes insulin resistance and decreases</p><p>glucose uptake and utilization by target tissues</p><p>such as muscle and adipose tissue. These effects</p><p>are called “diabetogenic” because they produce an</p><p>increase in blood glucose concentration, as occurs</p><p>when insulin is lacking or when tissues are resistant</p><p>to insulin (e.g., diabetes mellitus). Growth hormone</p><p>also increases lipolysis in adipose tissue. As a conse-</p><p>quence of these metabolic effects, growth hormone</p><p>causes an increase in blood insulin levels.</p><p>♦ Increased protein synthesis and organ growth. In</p><p>virtually all organs, growth hormone increases the</p><p>uptake of amino acids and stimulates the synthesis</p><p>of DNA, RNA, and protein. These effects account for</p><p>the hormone’s growth-promoting actions: increased</p><p>lean body mass and increased organ size. As noted,</p><p>many of the growth effects of growth hormone are</p><p>mediated by somatomedins.</p><p>♦ Increased linear growth. The most striking effect</p><p>of growth hormone is its ability to increase linear</p><p>growth. Mediated by the somatomedins, growth</p><p>hormone alters every aspect of cartilage metabolism:</p><p>stimulation of DNA synthesis, RNA synthesis, and</p><p>protein synthesis. In growing bones, the epiphyseal</p><p>Growth hormone secretion is regulated by negative </p><p>feedback (see Fig. 9.11). Three feedback loops includ-</p><p>ing both long and short loops are involved. (1) GHRH </p><p>inhibits its own secretion from the hypothalamus via </p><p>an ultrashort-loop feedback. (2) Somatomedins, which </p><p>are byproducts of the growth hormone action on target </p><p>tissues, inhibit secretion of growth hormone by the </p><p>anterior pituitary. (3) Both growth hormone and </p><p>somatomedins stimulate the secretion of somatostatin </p><p>by the hypothalamus. The overall effect of this third </p><p>loop is inhibitory (i.e., negative feedback) because </p><p>somatostatin inhibits growth hormone secretion by the </p><p>anterior pituitary.</p><p>Actions of Growth Hormone</p><p>Growth hormone has multiple metabolic actions on </p><p>liver, muscle, adipose tissue, and bone, as well as </p><p>growth-promoting actions in virtually every other </p><p>organ. The actions of growth hormone include effects </p><p>on linear growth, protein synthesis and organ growth, </p><p>carbohydrate metabolism, and lipid metabolism.</p><p>Some of the actions of growth hormone result from </p><p>the hormone’s direct effect on target tissues such as </p><p>skeletal muscle, the liver, or adipose tissue. These </p><p>direct actions are mediated by tyrosine kinase–</p><p>associated receptors. Other actions of growth hormone </p><p>are mediated indirectly through the production of </p><p>somatomedins (or IGFs) in the liver. The most impor-</p><p>tant of the somatomedins is somatomedin C or IGF-1. </p><p>Somatomedins act on target tissues through IGF recep-</p><p>tors that are similar to the insulin receptor, having </p><p>intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and exhibiting </p><p>Hypothalamus</p><p>Anterior pituitary</p><p>Target tissues</p><p>Somatomedins</p><p>(IGFs)</p><p>GHRH</p><p>Somatostatin</p><p>(SRIF)</p><p>Growth hormone</p><p>Somatomedins</p><p>(IGFs)</p><p>+</p><p>–</p><p>+</p><p>+</p><p>–</p><p>–</p><p>Fig. 9.11 Regulation of growth hormone secretion.

The number of lactotrophs </p><p>increases during pregnancy and lactation when the </p><p>demand for prolactin is increased. Chemically, prolactin </p><p>is related to growth hormone, having 198 amino acids </p><p>in a single-chain polypeptide with 3 internal disulfide </p><p>bridges.</p><p>Stimuli that increase or decrease prolactin secretion </p><p>do so by altering transcription of the prolactin gene. </p><p>Thus TRH, a stimulant of prolactin secretion, increases </p><p>transcription of the prolactin gene, whereas dopamine, </p><p>an inhibitor of prolactin secretion, decreases transcrip-</p><p>tion of the gene.</p><p>Regulation of Prolactin Secretion</p><p>Figure 9.12 illustrates the hypothalamic control of </p><p>prolactin secretion. There are two regulatory paths </p><p>from the hypothalamus, one inhibitory (via dopamine, </p><p>which acts by decreasing cAMP levels) and the other </p><p>stimulatory (via TRH).</p><p>In persons who are not pregnant or lactating, pro-</p><p>lactin secretion is tonically inhibited by dopamine </p><p>(prolactin-inhibiting factor [PIF]) from the hypothala-</p><p>mus. In other words, the inhibitory effect of dopamine </p><p>dominates and overrides the stimulatory effect of TRH. </p><p>In contrast to other hypothalamic-releasing or release-</p><p>inhibiting hormones, which are peptides, dopamine is </p><p>a catecholamine.</p><p>Two questions arise regarding this inhibitory action </p><p>of dopamine: What is the source of hypothalamic </p><p>plates widen and more bone is laid down at the </p><p>ends of long bones. There also is increased metabo-</p><p>lism in cartilage-forming cells and proliferation of </p><p>chondrocytes.</p><p>Pathophysiology of Growth Hormone</p><p>The pathophysiology of growth hormone includes </p><p>deficiency or excess of the hormone, with predictable </p><p>effects on linear growth, organ growth, and carbohy-</p><p>drate and lipid metabolism.</p><p>Growth hormone deficiency in children causes </p><p>dwarfism, including failure to grow, short stature, mild </p><p>obesity, and delayed puberty. The causes of growth </p><p>hormone deficiency include defects at every step in </p><p>the hypothalamic–anterior pituitary–target tissue axis: </p><p>decreased secretion of GHRH due to hypothalamic </p><p>dysfunction; primary deficiencies of growth hormone </p><p>secretion from the anterior pituitary; failure to gen-</p><p>erate somatomedins in the liver; and deficiency of </p><p>growth hormone or somatomedin receptors in target </p><p>tissues (growth hormone resistance). Growth hormone </p><p>deficiency in children is treated with human growth </p><p>hormone replacement. One variant of dwarfism is </p><p>Laron dwarfism, in which growth hormone levels are </p><p>elevated and treatment with growth hormone is ineff-</p><p>ective. In these individuals, growth hormone receptors </p><p>are defective; thus growth hormone cannot cause </p><p>production of IGFs in target tissues.</p><p>Growth hormone excess causes acromegaly and is </p><p>most often due to a growth hormone–secreting pituitary </p><p>adenoma. The consequences of excess growth hormone </p><p>differ, depending on whether the excess occurs before </p><p>or after puberty. Before puberty, excessive levels of </p><p>growth hormone cause gigantism (increased linear </p><p>growth) because of intense hormonal stimulation at the </p><p>epiphyseal plates. After puberty, when linear growth </p><p>is complete and can no longer be influenced, excess </p><p>levels of growth hormone cause increased periosteal </p><p>bone growth, increased organ size, increased hand </p><p>and foot size, enlargement of the tongue, coarsen-</p><p>ing of facial features, insulin resistance, and glucose </p><p>intolerance. Conditions with excess secretion of growth </p><p>hormone are treated with somatostatin analogues </p><p>(e.g., octreotide), which, like endogenous somatosta-</p><p>tin, inhibit growth hormone secretion by the anterior  </p><p>pituitary.</p><p>Prolactin</p><p>Prolactin is the major hormone responsible for milk </p><p>production and also participates in the development of </p><p>the breasts. In nonpregnant, nonlactating females and </p><p>in males, blood levels of prolactin are low. However, </p><p>during pregnancy and lactation, blood levels of prolactin </p><p>increase, consistent with the hormone’s role in breast </p><p>development and lactogenesis (milk production).</p><p>Hypothalamus</p><p>Anterior pituitary</p><p>Breast</p><p>–</p><p>Dopamine</p><p>+</p><p>TRH</p><p>Prolactin</p><p>+</p><p>Fig. 9.12 Regulation of prolactin secretion. TRH, Thyrotro-</p><p>pin-releasing hormone. </p><p>414 • Physiology</p><p>♦ Breast development. At puberty, prolactin, with</p><p>estrogen and progesterone, stimulates proliferation</p><p>and branching of the mammary ducts. During preg-</p><p>nancy, prolactin (again with estrogen and progester-</p><p>one) stimulates growth and development of the</p><p>mammary alveoli, which will produce milk once</p><p>parturition occurs.</p><p>♦ Lactogenesis (milk production). The major action</p><p>of prolactin is stimulation of milk production and</p><p>secretion in response to suckling. (Interestingly,</p><p>pregnancy does not have to occur for lactation to be</p><p>possible; if there is sufficient stimulation of the</p><p>nipple, prolactin is secreted and milk is produced.)</p><p>Prolactin stimulates milk production by inducing the</p><p>synthesis of the components of milk including</p><p>lactose (the carbohydrate of milk), casein (the</p><p>protein of milk), and lipids. The mechanism of</p><p>action of prolactin on the breast involves binding of</p><p>prolactin to a cell membrane receptor and, via an</p><p>unknown second messenger, inducing transcription</p><p>of the genes for enzymes in the biosynthetic path-</p><p>ways for lactose, casein, and lipid.</p><p>Although prolactin levels are high during preg-</p><p>nancy, lactation does not occur because the high</p><p>levels of estrogen and progesterone down-regulate</p><p>prolactin receptors in the breast and block the action</p><p>of prolactin. At parturition, estrogen and progester-</p><p>one levels drop precipitously and their inhibitory</p><p>actions cease. Prolactin can then stimulate lactogen-</p><p>esis, and lactation can occur.</p><p>♦ Inhibition of ovulation. In females, prolactin</p><p>inhibits ovulation by inhibiting the synthesis and</p><p>release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)</p><p>(see Chapter 10). Inhibition of GnRH secretion</p><p>and, secondarily, inhibition of ovulation account</p><p>for the decreased fertility during breast-feeding.</p><p>In males with high prolactin levels (e.g., due to a</p><p>prolactinoma), there is a parallel inhibitory effect</p><p>on GnRH secretion and spermatogenesis, resulting</p><p>in infertility.</p><p>Pathophysiology of Prolactin</p><p>The pathophysiology of prolactin can involve either a </p><p>deficiency of prolactin, which results in the inability to </p><p>lactate, or an excess of prolactin, which causes galac-</p><p>torrhea (excessive milk production).</p><p>♦ Prolactin deficiency can be caused by either</p><p>destruction of the entire anterior lobe of the pitu-</p><p>itary or selective destruction of the lactotrophs.</p><p>Prolactin deficiency results, predictably, in a failure</p><p>to lactate.</p><p>♦ Prolactin excess can be caused by destruc-</p><p>tion of the hypothalamus, interruption of the</p><p>hypothalamic-hypophysial tract, or prolactinomas</p><p>dopamine? How does dopamine reach the anterior lobe? </p><p>There are three sources and three routes: (1) The major </p><p>source of dopamine is dopaminergic neurons in the </p><p>hypothalamus, which synthesize and secrete dopamine </p><p>into the median eminence. This dopamine enters capil-</p><p>laries that drain into the hypothalamic-hypophysial </p><p>portal vessels and deliver dopamine directly and in </p><p>high concentration to the anterior pituitary, where it </p><p>inhibits prolactin secretion. (2) Dopamine also is </p><p>secreted by dopaminergic neurons of the posterior lobe </p><p>of the pituitary, reaching the anterior lobe by short </p><p>connecting portal veins. (3) Finally, nonlactotroph cells </p><p>of the anterior pituitary secrete a small amount of </p><p>dopamine that diffuses a short distance to the lacto-</p><p>trophs and inhibits prolactin secretion by a paracrine </p><p>mechanism.</p><p>The factors that alter prolactin secretion are summa-</p><p>rized in Table 9.5. Prolactin inhibits its own secretion </p><p>by increasing the synthesis and secretion of dopamine </p><p>from the hypothalamus (see Fig. 9.12). This action </p><p>of prolactin constitutes negative feedback because </p><p>stimulation of dopamine secretion causes inhibition </p><p>of prolactin secretion. Pregnancy and breast-feeding </p><p>(suckling) are the most important stimuli for prolactin </p><p>secretion. For example, during breast-feeding, serum </p><p>prolactin levels can increase to more than 10-fold the </p><p>basal levels. During suckling, afferent fibers from the </p><p>nipple carry information to the hypothalamus and </p><p>inhibit dopamine secretion; by releasing the inhibitory </p><p>effect of dopamine, prolactin secretion is increased. The </p><p>effects of dopamine, dopamine agonists, and dopamine </p><p>antagonists on prolactin secretion are predictable, based </p><p>on feedback regulation (see Fig. 9.12). Thus dopamine </p><p>itself and dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine </p><p>inhibit prolactin secretion, whereas dopamine antago-</p><p>nists stimulate prolactin secretion by “inhibiting the </p><p>inhibition” by dopamine.</p><p>Actions of Prolactin</p><p>Prolactin, in a supportive role with estrogen and pro-</p><p>gesterone, stimulates development of the breasts, pro-</p><p>motes milk secretion from the breasts during lactation, </p><p>and suppresses ovulation.</p><p>TABLE 9.5 Factors Affecting Prolactin Secretion</p><p>Stimulatory Factors</p><p>Inhibitory Factors</p><p>Pregnancy (estrogen)</p><p>Breast-feeding</p><p>Sleep</p><p>Stress</p><p>TRH</p><p>Dopamine antagonists</p><p>Dopamine</p><p>Bromocriptine (dopamine </p><p>agonist)</p><p>Somatostatin</p><p>Prolactin (negative feedback)</p><p>TRH, Thyrotropin-releasing hormone.</p><p>9—Endocrine Physiology • 415 </p><p>synthesized in cell bodies of hypothalamic neurons  </p><p>and secreted from nerve terminals in the posterior </p><p>pituitary.</p><p>Synthesis and Secretion of Antidiuretic </p><p>Hormone and Oxytocin</p><p>Synthesis and Processing</p><p>ADH and oxytocin are homologous nonapeptides </p><p>(containing nine amino acids) (Figs. 9.13 and 9.14) that </p><p>are synthesized in the supraoptic and paraventricular </p><p>nuclei of the hypothalamus.

The precursor for </p><p>oxytocin is prepro-oxyphysin, which comprises a </p><p>signal peptide, oxytocin, and neurophysin I. In the </p><p>Golgi apparatus, the signal peptides are removed from </p><p>the preprohormones to form the prohormones, propres-</p><p>sophysin and pro-oxyphysin, and the prohormones are </p><p>packaged in secretory vesicles. The secretory vesicles, </p><p>containing the prohormones, then travel down the axon </p><p>of the neuron, through the hypothalamic-hypophysial </p><p>tract, to the posterior pituitary. En route to the poste-</p><p>rior pituitary, the neurophysins are cleaved from their </p><p>respective prohormones within the secretory vesicles.</p><p>Secretion</p><p>The secretory vesicles that arrive at the posterior pitu-</p><p>itary contain either ADH, neurophysin II, and glycopro-</p><p>tein or oxytocin and neurophysin I. Secretion is initiated </p><p>when an action potential is transmitted from the cell </p><p>body in the hypothalamus, down the axon to the nerve </p><p>terminal in the posterior pituitary. When the nerve </p><p>terminal is depolarized by the action potential, Ca2+ </p><p>enters the terminal, causing exocytosis of the secretory </p><p>granules containing ADH or oxytocin and their neuro-</p><p>physins. The secreted hormones enter nearby fenes-</p><p>trated capillaries and are carried to the systemic </p><p>circulation, which delivers the hormones to their target </p><p>tissues.</p><p>Antidiuretic Hormone</p><p>ADH (or vasopressin) is the major hormone concerned </p><p>with regulation of body fluid osmolarity. ADH is </p><p>secreted by the posterior pituitary in response to an </p><p>increase in serum osmolarity. ADH then acts on the </p><p>principal cells of the late distal tubule and collecting </p><p>duct to increase water reabsorption, thus decreasing </p><p>body fluid osmolarity back toward normal. Osmoregu-</p><p>lation and the actions of ADH on the kidney are dis-</p><p>cussed in Chapter 6.</p><p>Regulation of Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion</p><p>The factors that stimulate or inhibit the secretion  </p><p>of ADH by the posterior pituitary are summarized in  </p><p>Table 9.6.</p><p>Increased plasma osmolarity is the most important </p><p>physiologic stimulus for increasing ADH secretion (Fig. </p><p>9.15). For example, when a person is deprived of water, </p><p>serum osmolarity increases. The increase is sensed by </p><p>osmoreceptors in the anterior hypothalamus. Action </p><p>potentials are initiated in cell bodies of the nearby ADH </p><p>neurons and propagated down the axons, causing the </p><p>secretion of ADH from nerve terminals in the posterior </p><p>pituitary. Conversely, decreases in serum osmolarity </p><p>signal the hypothalamic osmoreceptors to inhibit the </p><p>secretion of ADH.</p><p>Hypovolemia, or volume contraction (e.g., due to </p><p>hemorrhage), is also a potent stimulus for ADH secre-</p><p>tion. Decreases in extracellular fluid (ECF) volume of </p><p>10% or more cause a decrease in arterial blood pressure </p><p>that is sensed by baroreceptors in the left atrium, </p><p>carotid artery, and aortic arch. This information about </p><p>blood pressure is transmitted via the vagus nerve to the </p><p>hypothalamus, which directs an increase in ADH secre-</p><p>tion. ADH then stimulates water reabsorption in the </p><p>collecting ducts, attempting to restore ECF volume. </p><p>Importantly, hypovolemia stimulates ADH secretion, </p><p>even when plasma osmolarity is lower than normal </p><p>(see Fig. 9.15). Conversely, hypervolemia (volume </p><p>expansion) inhibits ADH secretion, even when plasma </p><p>osmolarity is higher than normal.</p><p>Pain, nausea, hypoglycemia, and various drugs (e.g., </p><p>nicotine, opiates, antineoplastic agents) all stimulate </p><p>the secretion of ADH. Ethanol, α-adrenergic agonists, </p><p>and ANP inhibit secretion of ADH.</p><p>9—Endocrine Physiology • 417 </p><p>Central diabetes insipidus is caused by failure of </p><p>the posterior pituitary to secrete ADH. In this disorder, </p><p>circulating levels of ADH are low, the collecting ducts </p><p>are impermeable to water, and the urine cannot be </p><p>concentrated. Thus persons with central diabetes </p><p>insipidus produce large volumes of dilute urine, and </p><p>their body fluids become concentrated (e.g., increased </p><p>serum osmolarity, increased serum Na+ concentration). </p><p>Central diabetes insipidus is treated with an ADH </p><p>analogue, dDAVP.</p><p>In nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, the posterior </p><p>pituitary is normal but the principal cells of the collect-</p><p>ing duct are unresponsive to ADH due to a defect in </p><p>the V2 receptor, Gs protein, or adenylyl cyclase. As  </p><p>in central diabetes insipidus, water is not reabsorbed </p><p>in the collecting ducts and the urine cannot be concen-</p><p>trated, resulting in excretion of large volumes of dilute </p><p>urine. As a result, the body fluids become concentrated </p><p>and the serum osmolarity increases. In contrast to </p><p>central diabetes insipidus, however, ADH levels are </p><p>elevated in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus due to </p><p>stimulation of secretion by the increased serum osmo-</p><p>larity. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is treated with </p><p>thiazide diuretics. The usefulness of thiazide diuretics </p><p>in treating nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is explained </p><p>as follows: (1) Thiazide diuretics inhibit Na+ reabsorp-</p><p>tion in the early distal tubule. By preventing dilution </p><p>of the urine at that site, the final, excreted urine is  </p><p>less dilute (than it would be without treatment).  </p><p>(2) Thiazide diuretics decrease glomerular filtration </p><p>rate (GFR); because less water is filtered, less water  </p><p>is excreted. (3) Thiazide diuretics, by increasing Na+ </p><p>Actions of Antidiuretic Hormone</p><p>ADH (vasopressin) has two actions, one on the kidney </p><p>and the other on vascular smooth muscle. These actions </p><p>are mediated by different receptors, different intracel-</p><p>lular mechanisms, and different second messengers.</p><p>♦ Increase in water permeability. The major action</p><p>of ADH is to increase the water permeability of</p><p>principal cells in the late distal tubule and collecting</p><p>duct. The receptor for ADH on the principal cells is</p><p>a V2 receptor, which is coupled to adenylyl cyclase</p><p>via a Gs protein. The second messenger is cAMP,</p><p>which, via phosphorylation steps, directs the inser-</p><p>tion of water channels, aquaporin 2 (AQP2), in the</p><p>luminal membranes. The increased water permeabil-</p><p>ity of the principal cells allows water to be reabsorbed </p><p>by the collecting ducts and makes the urine concen-</p><p>trated, or hyperosmotic (see Chapter 6).</p><p>♦ Contraction of vascular smooth muscle. The</p><p>second action of ADH is to cause contraction of</p><p>vascular smooth muscle (as implied by its other</p><p>name, vasopressin). The receptor for ADH on vascu-</p><p>lar smooth muscle is a V1 receptor, which is coupled</p><p>to phospholipase C via a Gq protein. The second</p><p>messenger for this action is IP3/Ca2+, which pro-</p><p>duces contraction of vascular smooth muscle, con-</p><p>striction of arterioles, and increased total peripheral</p><p>resistance.</p><p>Pathophysiology of Antidiuretic Hormone</p><p>The pathophysiology of ADH is discussed in detail in </p><p>Chapter 6 and is summarized here.</p><p>Plasma osmolarity</p><p>(mOsm/L)</p><p>ADH</p><p>secretion</p><p>Volume</p><p>expansion</p><p>Volume</p><p>contraction</p><p>Normal</p><p>280</p><p>270</p><p>290</p><p>300</p><p>310</p><p>Fig. 9.15 Control of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion by osmolarity and extracel-</p><p>lular fluid volume. </p><p>418 • Physiology</p><p>Regulation of Oxytocin Secretion</p><p>Several factors cause the secretion of oxytocin from </p><p>the posterior pituitary including suckling; the sight, </p><p>sound, or smell of the infant; and dilation of the cervix  </p><p>(Table 9.7).</p><p>The major stimulus for oxytocin secretion is suck-</p><p>ling of the breast.

He is given </p><p>demeclocycline, an ADH antagonist, and is ordered to </p><p>severely limit his water intake.</p><p>EXPLANATION OF CASE. Upon his admission to the </p><p>hospital, the man’s serum [Na+] and serum osmolarity </p><p>are severely depressed (normal serum [Na+], 140 mEq/L; </p><p>normal serum osmolarity, 290 mOsm/L). Simultane-</p><p>ously, his urine is hyperosmotic, with a measured </p><p>osmolarity of 650 mOsm/L. In other words, his urine </p><p>is inappropriately concentrated, given his very dilute </p><p>serum osmolarity.</p><p>Independent of the posterior pituitary, the oat cell </p><p>carcinoma synthesized and secreted ADH and caused </p><p>the abnormal urine and serum values. Normally, ADH </p><p>is secreted by the posterior lobe of the pituitary, which </p><p>is under negative-feedback regulation by serum osmo-</p><p>larity. When the serum osmolarity decreases below </p><p>normal, ADH secretion by the posterior pituitary is </p><p>inhibited. However, ADH secretion by the tumor is not </p><p>under such negative feedback regulation, and ADH </p><p>secretion continues unabated (no matter how low the </p><p>serum osmolarity) and causes SIADH.</p><p>The man’s serum and urine values are explained as </p><p>follows: The tumor is secreting large amounts of ADH </p><p>(inappropriately). This ADH circulates to the kidney </p><p>and acts on the principal cells of the late distal tubule </p><p>and collecting duct to increase water reabsorption. The </p><p>reabsorbed water is added to the total body water, </p><p>diluting the solutes. Thus serum [Na+] and serum </p><p>osmolarity are diluted by the excess water reabsorbed </p><p>by the kidney. Although this dilution of serum osmolar-</p><p>ity turns off ADH secretion by the posterior pituitary, </p><p>it does not turn off ADH secretion by the tumor  </p><p>cells.</p><p>The man’s grand mal seizure was caused by swelling </p><p>of brain cells. The excess water reabsorbed by the </p><p>kidney was distributed throughout the total body water </p><p>including intracellular fluid (ICF). As water flowed into </p><p>the cells, their volume increased. For brain cells, this </p><p>swelling was catastrophic because the brain is encased </p><p>in a fixed cavity, the skull.</p><p>TREATMENT. The man is treated promptly with an </p><p>infusion of hypertonic NaCl to raise the osmolarity of </p><p>his ECF. As extracellular osmolarity becomes higher </p><p>than intracellular osmolarity, water flows out of the </p><p>cells, driven by the osmotic gradient, and decreases ICF </p><p>volume. For brain cells, the reduction in cell volume </p><p>decreases the probability of another seizure.</p><p>The man’s lung tumor is inoperable and will </p><p>continue to secrete large quantities of ADH. His treat-</p><p>ment includes water restriction and administration of </p><p>demeclocycline, an ADH antagonist that blocks the </p><p>effect of ADH on water reabsorption in the principal  </p><p>cells.</p><p>TABLE 9.7 Factors Affecting Oxytocin Secretion</p><p>Stimulatory Factors</p><p>Inhibitory Factors</p><p>Suckling</p><p>Sight, sound, or smell of </p><p>the infant</p><p>Dilation of the cervix</p><p>Orgasm</p><p>Opioids (endorphins)</p><p>9—Endocrine Physiology • 419 </p><p>on virtually every organ system in the body including </p><p>those involved in normal growth and development.

In </p><p>1891, such patients were treated by administering crude </p><p>thyroid extracts (i.e., hormone replacement therapy). </p><p>Disorders of thyroid deficiency and excess are among </p><p>the most common of the endocrinopathies (disorders </p><p>of the endocrine glands), affecting 4% to 5% of the </p><p>population in the United States and an even greater </p><p>percentage of people in regions of the world where </p><p>there is iodine deficiency.</p><p>Synthesis and Transport of Thyroid Hormones</p><p>The two active thyroid hormones are triiodothyronine </p><p>(T3) and tetraiodothyronine, or thyroxine (T4). The </p><p>structures of T3 and T4 differ only by a single atom of </p><p>iodine, as shown in Figure 9.16. Although T3 is more </p><p>active than T4, almost all hormonal output of the </p><p>thyroid gland is T4. This “problem” of secreting the less </p><p>active form is solved by the target tissues, which </p><p>convert T4 to T3. A third compound, reverse T3 (rT3; not </p><p>shown in Fig. 9.16), has no biologic activity.</p><p>Synthesis of Thyroid Hormones</p><p>Thyroid hormones are synthesized by the follicular </p><p>epithelial cells of the thyroid gland. The follicular </p><p>epithelial cells are arranged in circular follicles 200– </p><p>300 µm in diameter, as shown in Figure 9.17. The cells </p><p>have a basal membrane facing the blood and an apical </p><p>membrane facing the follicular lumen. The material in </p><p>the lumen of the follicles is colloid, which is composed </p><p>of newly synthesized thyroid hormones attached to </p><p>thyroglobulin (TG).

Within </p><p>seconds of suckling, oxytocin is secreted from nerve </p><p>terminals in the posterior pituitary. If suckling contin-</p><p>ues, new oxytocin is synthesized in the hypothalamic </p><p>cell bodies, travels down the axons, and replenishes the </p><p>oxytocin that was secreted.</p><p>Suckling is not required for oxytocin secretion; </p><p>conditioned responses to the sight, sound, or smell of </p><p>the infant also cause milk letdown. Oxytocin also is </p><p>secreted in response to dilation of the cervix during </p><p>labor and orgasm.</p><p>Actions of Oxytocin</p><p>♦ Milk ejection. Prolactin stimulates lactogenesis. The</p><p>milk is stored in mammary alveoli and small milk</p><p>ducts. The major action of oxytocin is to cause milk</p><p>letdown. When oxytocin is secreted in response to</p><p>suckling or to conditioned responses, it causes</p><p>contraction of myoepithelial cells lining these small</p><p>ducts, forcing the milk into large ducts. The milk</p><p>collects in cisterns and then flows out through the</p><p>nipple.</p><p>♦ Uterine contraction. At a very low concentration,</p><p>oxytocin also causes powerful rhythmic contractions</p><p>of uterine smooth muscle. Although it is tempting to</p><p>speculate that oxytocin is the critical hormone</p><p>involved in parturition, it is unclear whether oxyto-</p><p>cin plays a physiologic role in either the initiation of</p><p>or the normal course of labor. However, this action</p><p>of oxytocin is the basis for its use in inducing labor</p><p>and in reducing postpartum bleeding.</p><p>THYROID HORMONES</p><p>Thyroid hormones are synthesized and secreted by </p><p>epithelial cells of the thyroid gland. They have effects </p><p>420 • Physiology</p><p>cells and interfere with the synthesis of thyroid </p><p>hormones.</p><p>3. Oxidation of I− to I2. Once I− is pumped into the cell,</p><p>it traverses the cell to the apical membrane, where</p><p>it is oxidized to I2 by the enzyme thyroid peroxidase.</p><p>Thyroid peroxidase catalyzes this oxidation step and</p><p>the next two steps (i.e., organification of I2 into TG</p><p>and the coupling reactions).</p><p>Thyroid peroxidase is inhibited by propylthioura-</p><p>cil (PTU), which blocks the synthesis of thyroid </p><p>hormones by blocking all of the steps catalyzed by </p><p>thyroid peroxidase. Thus administration of PTU is </p><p>an effective treatment for hyperthyroidism.</p><p>4. Organification of I2. At the apical membrane, just</p><p>inside the lumen of the follicle, I2 combines with the</p><p>tyrosine moieties of TG, catalyzed by thyroid peroxi-</p><p>dase, to form monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodo-</p><p>tyrosine (DIT). MIT and DIT remain attached to TG</p><p>in the follicular lumen until the thyroid gland is</p><p>stimulated to secrete its hormones. High levels of</p><p>I− inhibit organification and synthesis of thyroid</p><p>hormones, which is known as the Wolff-Chaikoff</p><p>effect.</p><p>5. Coupling reaction. While still part of TG, two sepa-</p><p>rate coupling reactions occur between MIT and DIT,</p><p>again catalyzed by thyroid peroxidase. In one reac-</p><p>tion, two molecules of DIT combine to form T4. In</p><p>the other reaction, one molecule of DIT combines</p><p>with one molecule of MIT to form T3. The first</p><p>reaction is faster, and as a result, approximately 10</p><p>times more T4 is produced than T3. A portion of MIT</p><p>and DIT does not couple (is “left over”) and simply</p><p>remains attached to TG. After the coupling reactions</p><p>occur, TG contains T4, T3, and leftover MIT and DIT.</p><p>This iodinated TG is stored in the follicular lumen</p><p>as colloid until the thyroid gland is stimulated to</p><p>secrete its hormones (e.g., by TSH).</p><p>6. Endocytosis of thyroglobulin. When the thyroid</p><p>gland is stimulated, iodinated TG (with its attached</p><p>T4, T3, MIT, and DIT) is endocytosed into the follicu-</p><p>lar epithelial cells. Pseudopods are pinched off the</p><p>apical cell membrane, engulf a portion of colloid,</p><p>and absorb it into the cell. Once inside the cell, TG</p><p>is transported in the direction of the basal membrane</p><p>by microtubular action.</p><p>7. Hydrolysis of T4 and T3 from TG by lysosomal</p><p>enzymes. TG droplets fuse with lysosomal mem-</p><p>branes. Lysosomal proteases then hydrolyze peptide</p><p>bonds to release T4, T3, MIT, and DIT from TG. T4</p><p>and T3 are transported across the basal membrane</p><p>into nearby capillaries to be delivered to the systemic</p><p>circulation; the gland secretes 90% of its thyroid</p><p>hormone as T4 and 10% as T3. MIT and DIT remain</p><p>The synthesis of thyroid hormones is more complex </p><p>than that of most hormones. There are three unusual </p><p>features of the synthetic process: (1) Thyroid hormones </p><p>contain large amounts of iodine, which must be ade-</p><p>quately supplied in the diet. (2) Synthesis of thyroid </p><p>hormones is partially intracellular and partially extra-</p><p>cellular, with the completed hormones stored extracel-</p><p>lularly in the follicular lumen until the thyroid gland is </p><p>stimulated to secrete. (3) As noted, although T4 is the </p><p>major secretory product of the thyroid gland, it is not </p><p>the most active form of the hormone.</p><p>The steps in thyroid hormone biosynthesis in follicu-</p><p>lar epithelial cells are illustrated in Figure 9.18. The </p><p>circled numbers in the figure correlate with the follow-</p><p>ing steps:</p><p>1. Thyroglobulin (TG), a glycoprotein containing large</p><p>quantities of tyrosine, is synthesized on the rough</p><p>endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus of</p><p>the thyroid follicular cells. TG is then incorporated</p><p>into secretory vesicles and extruded across the apical</p><p>membrane into the follicular lumen. Later, the tyro-</p><p>sine residues of TG will be iodinated to form the</p><p>precursors of thyroid hormones.</p><p>2. Na+-I− cotransport, or “I-trap.” I− is actively trans-</p><p>ported from blood into the follicular epithelial cells</p><p>against both chemical and electrical gradients. The</p><p>activity of this pump is regulated by I− levels in</p><p>the body. For example, low levels of I− stimulate</p><p>the pump.

This “problem” is solved in the target tissues </p><p>by the enzyme 5′-iodinase, which converts T4 to T3 by </p><p>removing one atom of I2 from the outer ring of the </p><p>molecule. The target tissues also convert a portion of </p><p>the T4 to reverse T3 (rT3) by removing one atom of I2 </p><p>from the inner ring of the molecule; rT3 is inactive. </p><p>Essentially, T4 serves as a precursor for T3, and the rela-</p><p>tive amounts of T4 converted to T3 and rT3 determine </p><p>how much active hormone is produced in the target </p><p>tissue.</p><p>In starvation (fasting), target tissue 5′-iodinase </p><p>plays an interesting role. Starvation inhibits 5′-iodinase </p><p>in tissues such as skeletal muscle, thus lowering O2 </p><p>consumption and basal metabolic rate (BMR) during </p><p>periods of caloric deprivation. However, brain 5′-iodin-</p><p>ase differs from the 5′-iodinase in other tissues and </p><p>is therefore not inhibited in starvation; in this way, </p><p>brain levels of T3 are protected even during caloric </p><p>deprivation.</p><p>Regulation of Thyroid Hormone Secretion</p><p>The factors that increase or decrease the secretion of </p><p>thyroid hormones are summarized in Table 9.8. Major </p><p>control of the synthesis and secretion of thyroid  </p><p>hormones is via the hypothalamic-pituitary axis  </p><p>(Fig. 9.19).

Deiodination of MIT and DIT. MIT and DIT are</p><p>deiodinated inside the follicular cell by the enzyme</p><p>thyroid deiodinase. The I− generated by this step is</p><p>recycled into the intracellular pool and added to the</p><p>I− transported by the pump. The tyrosine molecules</p><p>are incorporated into the synthesis of new TG to</p><p>begin another cycle. Thus both I− and tyrosine are</p><p>“salvaged” by the deiodinase enzyme. A deficiency</p><p>of thyroid deiodinase therefore mimics dietary</p><p>I− deficiency.</p><p>Binding of Thyroid Hormones in the Circulation</p><p>Thyroid hormones (T4 and T3) circulate in the blood-</p><p>stream either bound to plasma proteins or free </p><p>(unbound). Most T4 and T3 circulates bound to </p><p>thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG). Smaller amounts </p><p>circulate bound to T4-binding prealbumin and albumin. </p><p>Still smaller amounts circulate in the free, unbound </p><p>form. Because only free thyroid hormones are physio-</p><p>logically active, the role of TBG is to provide a large </p><p>reservoir of circulating thyroid hormones, which can </p><p>be released and added to the pool of free hormone.</p><p>Changes in the blood levels of TBG alter the fraction </p><p>of free (physiologically active) thyroid hormones. For </p><p>example, in hepatic failure, blood levels of TBG </p><p>decrease because there is decreased hepatic protein </p><p>synthesis. The decrease in TBG levels results in a </p><p>transient increase in the level of free thyroid hormones; </p><p>a consequence of increased free thyroid hormone is </p><p>inhibition of synthesis of thyroid hormones (by nega-</p><p>tive feedback). In contrast, during pregnancy, the high </p><p>level of estrogen inhibits hepatic breakdown of TBG </p><p>and increases TBG levels. With a higher level of TBG, </p><p>more thyroid hormone is bound to TBG and less thyroid </p><p>hormone is free and unbound. The transiently decreased </p><p>level of free hormone causes, by negative feedback, </p><p>increased synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones </p><p>by the thyroid gland. In pregnancy, as a consequence </p><p>of all these changes, levels of total T4 and T3 are </p><p>increased (due to the increased level of TBG), but levels </p><p>of free, physiologically active, thyroid hormones are </p><p>normal and the person is said to be “clinically </p><p>euthyroid.”</p><p>Circulating levels of TBG can be indirectly assessed </p><p>with the T3 resin uptake test, which measures the </p><p>binding of radioactive T3 to a synthetic resin. In the </p><p>test, a standard amount of radioactive T3 is added to </p><p>an assay system that contains a sample of the patient’s </p><p>serum and the T3-binding resin. The rationale is that </p><p>radioactive T3 will first bind to unoccupied sites on the </p><p>patient’s TBG and any “leftover” radioactive T3 will </p><p>bind to the resin. Thus T3 resin uptake is increased </p><p>when circulating levels of TBG are decreased (e.g., </p><p>TABLE 9.8 Factors Affecting Thyroid </p><p>Hormone Secretion</p><p>Stimulatory Factors</p><p>Inhibitory Factors</p><p>TSH</p><p>Thyroid-stimulating </p><p>immunoglobulins</p><p>Increased TBG levels </p><p>(e.g., pregnancy)</p><p>I− deficiency</p><p>Deiodinase deficiency</p><p>Excessive I− intake (Wolff-</p><p>Chaikoff effect)</p><p>Perchlorate, thiocyanate </p><p>(inhibit Na+-I− cotransport)</p><p>Propylthiouracil (inhibits </p><p>peroxidase enzyme)</p><p>Decreased TBG levels (e.g., </p><p>liver disease)</p><p>TBG, Thyroxine-binding globulin; TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone.</p><p>9—Endocrine Physiology • 423 </p><p>relatively steady rate of TSH secretion, which in turn </p><p>produces a steady rate of secretion of thyroid hor-</p><p>mones (in contrast to growth hormone secretion, </p><p>whose secretion is pulsatile).</p><p>♦ The actions of TSH on the thyroid gland are initi-</p><p>ated when TSH binds to a membrane receptor, which</p><p>is coupled to adenylyl cyclase via a Gs protein.</p><p>Activation of adenylyl cyclase generates cAMP,</p><p>which serves as the second messenger for TSH. TSH</p><p>has two types of actions on the thyroid gland. (1) It</p><p>increases the synthesis and secretion of thyroid</p><p>hormones by stimulating every step in the biosyn-</p><p>thetic pathway: I− uptake and oxidation, organifica-</p><p>tion of I2 into MIT and DIT, coupling of MIT and DIT</p><p>to form T4 and T3, endocytosis, and proteolysis of</p><p>TG to release T4 and T3 for secretion. (2) TSH has a</p><p>trophic effect on the thyroid gland. This trophic</p><p>effect is exhibited when TSH levels are elevated for</p><p>a sustained period of time and leads to hypertrophy</p><p>and hyperplasia of thyroid follicular cells and</p><p>increased thyroidal blood flow.</p><p>♦ The TSH receptor on the thyroid cells also is acti-</p><p>vated by thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins,</p><p>which are antibodies to the TSH receptor. Thyroid-</p><p>stimulating immunoglobulins are components of the</p><p>immunoglobulin G (IgG) fraction of plasma proteins.</p><p>When these immunoglobulins bind to the TSH recep-</p><p>tor, they produce the same response in thyroid cells</p><p>as TSH: stimulation of thyroid hormone synthesis</p><p>and secretion and hypertrophy and hyperplasia of</p><p>the gland (i.e., hyperthyroidism). Graves disease,</p><p>a common form of hyperthyroidism, is caused by</p><p>increased circulating levels of thyroid-stimulating</p><p>immunoglobulins. In this disorder, the thyroid gland</p><p>is intensely stimulated by the antibodies, causing cir-</p><p>culating levels of thyroid hormones to be increased.</p><p>In Graves disease, TSH levels are actually lower</p><p>than normal because the high-circulating levels of</p><p>thyroid hormones inhibit TSH secretion by negative</p><p>feedback.</p><p>Actions of Thyroid Hormones</p><p>Thyroid hormones act on virtually every organ system </p><p>in the human body (Fig. 9.20): Thyroid hormones act </p><p>synergistically with growth hormone and somatome-</p><p>dins to promote bone formation; they increase BMR, </p><p>heat production, and oxygen consumption; and they </p><p>alter the cardiovascular and respiratory systems to </p><p>increase blood flow and oxygen delivery to the tissues.</p><p>The first step in the action of thyroid hormones in </p><p>target tissues is conversion of T4 to T3 by 5′-iodinase. </p><p>(Recall that T4 is secreted in far greater amounts than </p><p>T3, but it also is much less active.) In an alternate </p><p>pathway, T4 can be converted to rT3, which is </p><p>secretion of TSH.

TRH then acts on the</p><p>thyrotrophs of the anterior pituitary to stimulate</p><p>both transcription of the TSH gene and secretion of</p><p>TSH. (Recall that the other action of TRH is to stimu-</p><p>late the secretion of prolactin by the anterior</p><p>pituitary.)</p><p>♦ TSH, a glycoprotein, is secreted by the anterior lobe</p><p>of the pituitary in response to stimulation by TRH.</p><p>The role of TSH is to regulate the growth of the</p><p>thyroid gland (i.e., a trophic effect) and the secretion</p><p>of thyroid hormones by influencing several steps in</p><p>the biosynthetic pathway.

(1) TRH from the hypothalamus stimulates </p><p>the secretion of TSH. (2) Thyroid hormones inhibit </p><p>the secretion of TSH by down-regulating the TRH </p><p>receptor on the thyrotrophs, thus decreasing their </p><p>sensitivity to stimulation by TRH.

Thyroid hormone is required for growth to</p><p>adult stature. Thyroid hormones act synergistically</p><p>with growth hormone and somatomedins to promote</p><p>bone formation. Thyroid hormones promote ossifi-</p><p>cation and fusion of bone plates and bone matura-</p><p>tion. In hypothyroidism, bone age is less than</p><p>chronologic age.</p><p>♦ Central nervous system (CNS). Thyroid hormones</p><p>have multiple effects on the CNS, and the impact of</p><p>these effects is age dependent. In the perinatal</p><p>period, thyroid hormone is essential for normal</p><p>maturation of the CNS. Hypothyroidism in the peri-</p><p>natal period causes irreversible mental retardation.</p><p>For this reason, screening of newborns for hypothy-</p><p>roidism is mandated; if it is detected in the newborn,</p><p>thyroid hormone replacement can reverse the CNS</p><p>effects. In adults, hypothyroidism causes listless-</p><p>ness, slowed movement, somnolence, impaired</p><p>memory, and decreased mental capacity. Hyperthy-</p><p>roidism causes hyperexcitability, hyperreflexia, and</p><p>irritability.</p><p>♦ Autonomic nervous system. Thyroid hormones</p><p>interact with the sympathetic nervous system in</p><p>ways that are not fully understood. Many of the</p><p>effects of thyroid hormones on BMR, heat produc-</p><p>tion, heart rate, and stroke volume are similar to</p><p>those produced by catecholamines via β-adrenergic</p><p>receptors. The effects of thyroid hormones and</p><p>catecholamines on heat production, cardiac output,</p><p>lipolysis, and gluconeogenesis appear to be synergis-</p><p>tic. The significance of this synergism is illustrated</p><p>by the effectiveness of β-adrenergic blocking agents</p><p>(e.g., propranolol) in treating many of the symptoms</p><p>of hyperthyroidism.</p><p>Pathophysiology of Thyroid Hormone</p><p>The most common endocrine abnormalities are distur-</p><p>bances of thyroid hormones. The constellation of signs </p><p>and symptoms produced by an excess or a deficiency </p><p>of thyroid hormones is predictable on the basis of the </p><p>hormones’ physiologic actions. Thus disturbances of </p><p>thyroid hormones will affect growth, CNS function, </p><p>BMR and heat production, nutrient metabolism, and </p><p>the cardiovascular system. The symptoms of hyperthy-</p><p>roidism and hypothyroidism, common etiologies, TSH </p><p>levels, and treatments are summarized in Table 9.9.</p><p>synthesis is induced, which leads to increased oxygen </p><p>consumption, BMR, and heat production. In myocardial </p><p>cells, myosin, β1-adrenergic receptors, and Ca2+ ATPase </p><p>are induced, accounting for thyroid hormone–induced </p><p>increases in heart rate and contractility. In liver and </p><p>adipose tissue, key metabolic enzymes are induced, </p><p>leading to alterations in carbohydrate, fat, and protein </p><p>metabolism.</p><p>The effects of thyroid hormone (T3) on various organ </p><p>systems are as follows:</p><p>♦ Basal metabolic rate (BMR). One of the most sig-</p><p>nificant and pronounced effects of thyroid hormone</p><p>is increased oxygen consumption and a resulting</p><p>increase in BMR and body temperature. Thyroid</p><p>hormones increase oxygen consumption in all tissues</p><p>except brain, gonads, and spleen by inducing the</p><p>synthesis and increasing the activity of the Na+-K+</p><p>ATPase. The Na+-K+ ATPase is responsible for</p><p>primary active transport of Na+ and K+ in all cells;</p><p>this activity is highly correlated with and accounts</p><p>for a large percentage of the total oxygen consump-</p><p>tion and heat production in the body. Thus when</p><p>thyroid hormones increase Na+-K+ ATPase activity,</p><p>they also increase oxygen consumption, BMR, and</p><p>heat production.</p><p>♦ Metabolism. Ultimately, increased oxygen consump-</p><p>tion depends on increased availability of substrates</p><p>for oxidative metabolism. Thyroid hormones increase </p><p>glucose absorption from the gastrointestinal tract</p><p>and potentiate the effects of other hormones (e.g.,</p><p>catecholamines, glucagon, growth hormone) on</p><p>gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, and proteolysis. Thyroid</p><p>hormones increase both protein synthesis and deg-</p><p>radation, but overall their effect is catabolic (i.e., net</p><p>degradation), which results in decreased muscle</p><p>mass. These metabolic effects occur because thyroid</p><p>hormones induce the synthesis of key metabolic</p><p>enzymes including cytochrome oxidase, NADPH</p><p>cytochrome C reductase, α-glycerophosphate dehy-</p><p>drogenase, malic enzyme, and several proteolytic</p><p>enzymes.</p><p>♦ Cardiovascular and respiratory. Because thyroid</p><p>hormones increase O2 consumption, they create a</p><p>higher demand for O2 in the tissues. Increased O2</p><p>delivery to the tissues is possible because thyroid</p><p>hormones produce an increase in cardiac output and</p><p>ventilation. The increase in cardiac output is the</p><p>result of a combination of increased heart rate and</p><p>increased stroke volume (increased contractility).</p><p>These cardiac effects are explained by the fact that</p><p>thyroid hormones induce the synthesis of (i.e., up-</p><p>regulate) cardiac β1-adrenergic receptors. Recall that</p><p>these β1 receptors mediate the effects of the sympa-</p><p>thetic nervous system to increase heart rate and</p><p>426 • Physiology</p><p>(i.e., the disorder is in the hypothalamus or anterior </p><p>pituitary), then TSH levels will be increased.</p><p>The symptoms of hyperthyroidism are dramatic </p><p>and include weight loss accompanied by increased food </p><p>intake due to the increased metabolic rate; excessive </p><p>heat production and sweating secondary to increased </p><p>oxygen consumption; rapid heart rate due to up-</p><p>regulation of β1 receptors in the heart; breathlessness on </p><p>exertion; and tremor, nervousness, and weakness due </p><p>to the CNS effects of thyroid hormones. The increased </p><p>activity of the thyroid gland causes it to enlarge, called </p><p>goiter. The goiter may compress the esophagus and </p><p>cause difficulty in swallowing.</p><p>Treatment of hyperthyroidism includes administra-</p><p>tion of drugs such as propylthiouracil, which inhibit </p><p>the synthesis of thyroid hormones; surgical removal of </p><p>the gland; or radioactive ablation of the thyroid gland </p><p>with 131I−.</p><p>Hypothyroidism</p><p>The most common cause of hypothyroidism is auto-</p><p>immune destruction of the thyroid gland (thyroiditis) </p><p>Hyperthyroidism</p><p>The most common form of hyperthyroidism is Graves </p><p>disease, an autoimmune disorder characterized by </p><p>increased circulating levels of thyroid-stimulating </p><p>immunoglobulins. These immunoglobulins are anti-</p><p>bodies to TSH receptors on thyroid follicular cells. </p><p>When present, the antibodies intensely stimulate the </p><p>thyroid gland, resulting in increased secretion of thyroid </p><p>hormones and hypertrophy of the gland. Other causes </p><p>of hyperthyroidism are thyroid neoplasm, excessive </p><p>secretion of TRH or TSH, and administration of exces-</p><p>sive amounts of exogenous thyroid hormones.</p><p>The diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is based on </p><p>symptoms and measurement of increased levels of T3 </p><p>and T4. TSH levels may be decreased or increased, </p><p>depending on the cause of the hyperthyroidism. If the </p><p>cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves disease, thyroid </p><p>neoplasm (i.e., the disorder is in the thyroid gland), </p><p>or exogenous administration of thyroid hormones </p><p>(factitious hyperthyroidism), then TSH levels will be </p><p>decreased by negative feedback of the high levels of </p><p>T3 on the anterior pituitary.

TSH-secreting tumors are an</p><p>uncommon cause of hyperthyroidism. Increased</p><p>levels of TSH drive the thyroid to secrete excess T4</p><p>and T3 and have a trophic effect on the thyroid gland</p><p>to produce goiter.</p><p>♦ Ingestion of T4. Ingestion of exogenous thyroid</p><p>hormones, or factitious hyperthyroidism, is associ-</p><p>ated with increased levels of thyroid hormone (from</p><p>the ingestion), which causes decreased levels of TSH</p><p>(by negative feedback). Because TSH levels are low</p><p>there is no goiter; in fact, with time, the thyroid</p><p>gland shrinks, or involutes.</p><p>♦ Autoimmune thyroiditis. Autoimmune thyroiditis is</p><p>a common cause of hypothyroidism, in which thyroid</p><p>hormone synthesis is impaired by antibodies to</p><p>peroxidase, leading to decreased T4 and T3 secretion.</p><p>TSH levels are increased (by negative feedback), and</p><p>the resulting high levels of TSH have a trophic effect</p><p>on the thyroid gland to produce goiter. That’s right!</p><p>The gland enlarges even though it is not effectively</p><p>synthesizing thyroid hormones.</p><p>♦ TSH deficiency (anterior pituitary failure). TSH</p><p>deficiency is an uncommon cause of hypothyroid-</p><p>ism, where the decreased levels of TSH cause</p><p>decreased thyroid hormone secretion and no goiter.</p><p>♦ I− deficiency. Deficiency of I− leads to transiently</p><p>decreased synthesis of T4 and T3, which increases</p><p>TSH secretion by negative feedback. Increased TSH</p><p>levels then have a trophic effect on the gland, causing</p><p>goiter. The enlarged gland (which is otherwise</p><p>normal) can often maintain normal blood levels of</p><p>thyroid hormone (due to the high TSH levels); in</p><p>that case, the person will be clinically euthyroid and</p><p>asymptomatic. If the gland cannot maintain normal</p><p>blood levels of thyroid hormone, then the person</p><p>will be clinically hypothyroid.</p><p>ADRENAL MEDULLA AND CORTEX</p><p>The adrenal glands are located in the retroperitoneal </p><p>cavity above each kidney. The adrenal glands are actu-</p><p>ally two separate glands, the adrenal medulla and the </p><p>adrenal cortex, whose secretions are essential for life. </p><p>in which antibodies may either frankly destroy the </p><p>gland or block thyroid hormone synthesis. Other causes </p><p>of hypothyroidism are surgical removal of the thyroid </p><p>as treatment for hyperthyroidism, hypothalamic or </p><p>pituitary failure, and I− deficiency. Rarely, hypothyroid-</p><p>ism is the result of target tissue resistance caused by </p><p>down-regulation of thyroid-hormone receptors.</p><p>The diagnosis of hypothyroidism is based on symp-</p><p>toms and a finding of decreased levels of T3 and T4. </p><p>Depending on the cause of the hypothyroidism, TSH </p><p>levels may be increased or decreased. If the defect is </p><p>in the thyroid gland (e.g., thyroiditis), TSH levels will </p><p>be increased by negative feedback; the low circulating </p><p>levels of T3 stimulate TSH secretion. If the defect is in </p><p>the hypothalamus or pituitary, then TSH levels will be </p><p>decreased.</p><p>The symptoms of hypothyroidism are opposite </p><p>those seen in hyperthyroidism and include decreased </p><p>metabolic rate and weight gain without increased food </p><p>intake; decreased heat production and cold intolerance; </p><p>decreased heart rate; slowing of movement, slurred </p><p>speech, slowed mental activity, lethargy, and somno-</p><p>lence; periorbital puffiness; constipation; hair loss; and </p><p>menstrual dysfunction. In some cases, myxedema </p><p>develops, in which there is increased filtration of fluid </p><p>out of the capillaries and edema due to accumulation </p><p>of osmotically active mucopolysaccharides in interstitial </p><p>fluid. When the cause of hypothyroidism is a defect in </p><p>the thyroid, a goiter develops from the unrelenting </p><p>stimulation of the thyroid gland by the high circulating </p><p>levels of TSH. Finally, and of critical importance, if </p><p>hypothyroidism occurs in the perinatal period and is </p><p>untreated, it results in an irreversible form of growth </p><p>and mental retardation called cretinism.</p><p>Treatment of hypothyroidism involves thyroid </p><p>hormone replacement therapy, usually T4. Like endog-</p><p>enous hormone, exogenous T4 is converted to its active </p><p>form, T3, in the target tissues.</p><p>Goiter</p><p>Goiter (i.e., enlarged thyroid) can be associated with </p><p>certain causes of hyperthyroidism and also, perhaps </p><p>surprisingly, with certain causes of hypothyroidism </p><p>and euthyroidism. The terms hyperthyroid, hypothy-</p><p>roid, and euthyroid describe, respectively, the clinical </p><p>states of excess thyroid hormone, deficiency of thyroid </p><p>hormone, and normal levels of thyroid hormone. Thus </p><p>they describe blood levels of thyroid hormone, not the </p><p>size of the thyroid gland. The presence or absence of </p><p>goiter can be understood only by analyzing the etiology </p><p>of the various thyroid disorders. The central principle </p><p>in understanding goiter is that high levels of TSH and </p><p>substances that act like TSH (e.g., thyroid-stimulating </p><p>immunoglobulins) have a trophic (growth) effect on </p><p>the thyroid and cause it to enlarge.</p><p>428 • Physiology</p><p>Structures of Adrenocortical Steroids</p><p>The structures of the major adrenocortical steroids are </p><p>shown in Figure 9.22, which should be used as a refer-</p><p>ence throughout this section. All of the steroids of the </p><p>adrenal cortex are chemical modifications of a basic </p><p>steroid nucleus, which is illustrated in the structure of </p><p>cholesterol. The basic nucleus is a carbon skeleton, </p><p>with carbons numbered from 1 through 21 and four </p><p>labeled rings: A, B, C, and D. (Cholesterol is called, </p><p>therefore, a 21-carbon steroid.) The glucocorticoids, </p><p>represented by cortisol, have a ketone group at carbon </p><p>3 (C3) and hydroxyl groups at C11 and C21. The min-</p><p>eralocorticoids, represented by aldosterone, have a </p><p>double-bond oxygen at C18. The androgens, repre-</p><p>sented in the adrenal cortex by dehydroepiandrosterone </p><p>(DHEA) and androstenedione, have a double-bond </p><p>oxygen at C17; androgens do not have the C20,21 side </p><p>chain that is present in glucocorticoids and mineralo-</p><p>corticoids. Another androgen, testosterone (not shown </p><p>in Fig. 9.22), is produced primarily in the testes. </p><p>Estrogens (not shown), which are aromatized in the A </p><p>ring and are lacking C19, are produced primarily in the </p><p>ovaries.</p><p>In summary, cholesterol, progesterone, the glucocor-</p><p>ticoids, and the mineralocorticoids are 21-carbon ste-</p><p>roids; androgens are 19-carbon steroids; and estrogens </p><p>(produced primarily in the ovaries) are 18-carbon </p><p>steroids.</p><p>When corrected for weight, these glands receive among </p><p>the highest blood flow of any organ in the body.</p><p>The adrenal medulla, which is in the inner zone of </p><p>the gland, composes approximately 20% of the tissue. </p><p>The adrenal medulla is of neuroectodermal origin and </p><p>secretes the catecholamines epinephrine and norepi-</p><p>nephrine (see Chapter 2).</p><p>The adrenal cortex, which is in the outer zone of </p><p>the gland, is of mesodermal origin and has three distinct </p><p>layers. It composes 80% of the adrenal tissue and </p><p>secretes adrenocortical steroid hormones. The adrenal </p><p>cortex differentiates by gestational week 8 and is </p><p>responsible for the production of fetal adrenal steroids </p><p>throughout intrauterine life (see Chapter 10). Soon after </p><p>birth, the fetal adrenal cortex begins to involute, even-</p><p>tually disappears, and is replaced by the three-layered </p><p>adult adrenal cortex.</p><p>Synthesis of Adrenocortical Steroid Hormones</p><p>The adrenal cortex secretes three classes of steroid </p><p>hormones: glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and </p><p>androgens. Figure 9.21 shows the three layers of the </p><p>adrenal cortex in relation to the adrenal medulla. The </p><p>innermost zone of the cortex, called the zona reticu-</p><p>laris, and the middle (and widest) zone, called the zona </p><p>fasciculata, synthesize and secrete glucocorticoids and </p><p>adrenal androgens.

Metyrapone </p><p>inhibits 11β-hydroxylase, the last step in cortisol </p><p>synthesis. Ketoconazole inhibits several steps in the </p><p>pathway including cholesterol desmolase, the first </p><p>step.</p><p>♦ Adrenal androgens (DHEA and androstenedione).</p><p>DHEA and androstenedione are androgenic steroids</p><p>produced by the zonae fasciculata/reticularis.</p><p>These compounds have weak androgenic activity,</p><p>but in the testes they are converted to testosterone,</p><p>a more potent androgen. The precursors for the</p><p>adrenal androgens are 17-hydroxypregnenolone and</p><p>17-hydroxyprogesterone, which are converted to</p><p>androgens by removal of the C20,21 side chain. In</p><p>males, adrenal androgens are of little significance;</p><p>the testes produce their own testosterone from</p><p>cholesterol and do not require the adrenal precur-</p><p>sors (see Chapter 10). In females, however, the</p><p>adrenal cortex is the major source of androgenic</p><p>compounds.</p><p>Adrenal androgens have a ketone group at C17 </p><p>that distinguishes them from cortisol, aldosterone,</p><p>and testosterone. (Cortisol and aldosterone have side</p><p>chains at C17. Testosterone has a hydroxyl group at</p><p>C17.) Thus the major adrenal androgens are called</p><p>17-ketosteroids, which can be measured in the</p><p>urine.</p><p>The zonae fasciculata/reticularis also produce </p><p>small amounts of testosterone and 17β-estradiol,</p><p>although the major sources for these hormones are</p><p>the testes and ovaries, respectively (see Chapter 10).</p><p>♦ Mineralocorticoids (aldosterone). The major min-</p><p>eralocorticoid in the body is aldosterone, which</p><p>is synthesized only in the zona glomerulosa. The</p><p>steps required to convert cholesterol to cortico-</p><p>sterone are identical to those in the zona fasciculata,</p><p>and the addition of aldosterone synthase in the</p><p>zona glomerulosa converts corticosterone to aldo-</p><p>sterone. The zona glomerulosa does not produce</p><p>glucocorticoids for two reasons: (1) Corticosterone,</p><p>a glucocorticoid, is converted to aldosterone because</p><p>this zone contains aldosterone synthase, and (2) the</p><p>zona glomerulosa lacks 17α-hydroxylase and there-</p><p>fore is unable to produce cortisol from progesterone.</p><p>Aldosterone is not the only steroid with miner-</p><p>alocorticoid activity; 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC)</p><p>and corticosterone also have mineralocorticoid</p><p>activity. Thus if the mineralocorticoid pathway is</p><p>blocked below the level of DOC (e.g., absence of</p><p>cell by endocytosis. Inside the cells, cholesterol is </p><p>esterified and stored in cytoplasmic vesicles until it is </p><p>needed for synthesis of steroid hormones.</p><p>The enzymes catalyzing the conversion of choles-</p><p>terol to active steroid hormones require cytochrome </p><p>P-450, molecular oxygen, and NADPH, which serves </p><p>as the hydrogen donor for the reducing steps. A flavo-</p><p>protein enzyme called adrenodoxin reductase and an </p><p>iron-containing protein called adrenodoxin are inter-</p><p>mediates in the transfer of hydrogen from NADPH to </p><p>the cytochrome P-450 enzymes.</p><p>For purposes of illustration, all of the biosynthetic </p><p>pathways in the adrenal cortex are shown in Figure </p><p>9.23. Remember, however, that not all layers of the </p><p>cortex contain all of the steps in the pathway: Each </p><p>layer has that portion of the pathway necessary to </p><p>produce its primary hormones (i.e., glucocorticoids and </p><p>androgens or mineralocorticoids).</p><p>The first step in each pathway is catalyzed by cho-</p><p>lesterol desmolase. In this step, the long side chain </p><p>of cholesterol is removed (i.e., side-chain cleavage) </p><p>and cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone. Thus </p><p>all layers of the adrenal cortex contain cholesterol </p><p>desmolase. Cholesterol desmolase is the rate-limiting </p><p>enzyme in the pathway, and it is stimulated by ACTH </p><p>(see further discussion concerning regulation of cortisol </p><p>secretion). Follow the pathways for the synthesis of </p><p>cortisol, aldosterone, and DHEA and androstenedione:</p><p>♦ Glucocorticoids (cortisol). The major glucocorticoid</p><p>produced in humans is cortisol (hydrocortisone),</p><p>which is synthesized in the zonae fasciculata/</p><p>reticularis. Thus the zona fasciculata contains all of</p><p>the enzymes required to convert cholesterol to cortisol: </p><p>cholesterol desmolase, which converts cholesterol to</p><p>pregnenolone; 17α-hydroxylase, which hydroxylates</p><p>pregnenolone to form 17-hydroxypregnenolone; 3β-</p><p>hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which converts 17-</p><p>hydroxypregnenolone to 17-hydroxyprogesterone;</p><p>and 21β-hydroxylase and 11β-hydroxylase, which</p><p>hydroxylate at C11 and C21 to produce the final</p><p>product, cortisol. Interestingly, some steps in the</p><p>cortisol biosynthetic pathway can occur in a differ-</p><p>ent order; for example, hydroxylation at C17 can</p><p>occur before or after the action of 3β-hydroxysteroid</p><p>dehydrogenase.</p><p>Cortisol is not the only steroid in the pathway </p><p>with glucocorticoid activity; corticosterone is also a</p><p>glucocorticoid. For example, if the 17α-hydroxylase</p><p>step is blocked, the zona fasciculata still can produce</p><p>corticosterone without deleterious effect. Thus cor-</p><p>tisol is not absolutely necessary to sustain life as</p><p>long as corticosterone is being synthesized. Blocks at</p><p>the cholesterol desmolase, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehy-</p><p>drogenase, 21β-hydroxylase, or 11β-hydroxylase steps </p><p>432 • Physiology</p><p>bursts during a 24-hour period. The lowest secretory </p><p>rates occur during the evening hours and just after </p><p>falling asleep (e.g., midnight), and the highest secre-</p><p>tory rates occur just before awakening in the morning </p><p>(e.g., 8 AM). The major burst of cortisol secretion </p><p>before awakening accounts for one-half of the total </p><p>daily cortisol secretion. Other adrenal steroids (e.g., </p><p>adrenal androgens) are secreted in similar bursting </p><p>diurnal patterns. ACTH secretion also exhibits the same </p><p>diurnal pattern; in fact, it is the pattern of ACTH secre-</p><p>tion that drives the diurnal pattern of steroid hormone  </p><p>secretion.</p><p>The secretion of glucocorticoids by the zonae </p><p>fasciculata/reticularis is regulated exclusively by the </p><p>hypothalamic-pituitary axis (Fig. 9.25). CRH is secreted </p><p>by the hypothalamus and acts on the corticotrophs of </p><p>11β-hydroxylase or aldosterone synthase), mineralo-</p><p>corticoids will continue to be produced. However, if </p><p>the pathway is blocked above the level of DOC (e.g., </p><p>absence of 21β-hydroxylase), then no mineralocorti-</p><p>coids will be produced.</p><p>Regulation of Secretion of </p><p>Adrenocortical Steroids</p><p>As discussed previously, the synthesis and secretion of </p><p>steroid hormones by the adrenal cortex depend on the </p><p>stimulation of cholesterol desmolase (the first step) by </p><p>ACTH. In the absence of ACTH, biosynthesis of adre-</p><p>nocortical steroid hormones ceases. Two questions </p><p>arise, therefore: What regulates the secretion of ACTH? </p><p>What special regulatory factors control the functions of </p><p>the zonae reticularis, fasciculata, and glomerulosa?</p><p>♦ The zonae fasciculata/reticularis, which secrete</p><p>glucocorticoids and androgens, are under the exclu-</p><p>sive control of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. The</p><p>hypothalamic hormone is corticotropin-releasing</p><p>hormone (CRH), and the anterior pituitary hormone</p><p>is ACTH.</p><p>♦ The zona glomerulosa, which secretes mineralocor-</p><p>ticoids, depends on ACTH for the first step in steroid</p><p>biosynthesis, but otherwise it is controlled separately</p><p>via the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.</p><p>Control of the zonae fasciculata and reticularis will</p><p>be discussed together, and control of the zona glomeru-</p><p>losa will be discussed separately.</p><p>Regulation of Glucocorticoid and Adrenal </p><p>Androgen Secretion</p><p>An impressive feature of the regulation of cortisol </p><p>secretion is its pulsatile nature and its diurnal (daily) </p><p>pattern (Fig. 9.24).

The decreased level of ACTH then causes </p><p>decreased cortisol secretion, which is measured in </p><p>the test. The major use of the dexamethasone sup-</p><p>pression test is in persons with hypercortisolism </p><p>(high levels of cortisol). The test is used to determine </p><p>whether the hypercortisolism is due to an ACTH-</p><p>secreting tumor or a cortisol-secreting tumor of the </p><p>adrenal cortex. If the cause of hypercortisolism is an </p><p>ACTH-secreting tumor of the anterior pituitary, a </p><p>low dose of dexamethasone does not suppress cor-</p><p>tisol secretion but a high dose of dexamethasone </p><p>does. (The tumor’s ACTH secretion is less sensitive </p><p>to negative feedback by glucocorticoids than is </p><p>normal anterior pituitary tissue.) If the cause of </p><p>hypercortisolism is an adrenal cortical tumor, then </p><p>neither low-dose nor high-dose dexamethasone sup-</p><p>presses cortisol secretion. (The tumor’s secretion of </p><p>cortisol is autonomous and is not affected by changes </p><p>in the ACTH level.)</p><p>In addition to negative feedback control by the CRH-</p><p>ACTH axis, other factors alter ACTH and cortisol secre-</p><p>tion (Table 9.10). Many of these factors alter ACTH </p><p>secretion via effects of higher brain centers on the </p><p>hypothalamus.</p><p>Regulation of Aldosterone Secretion</p><p>The regulation of aldosterone secretion by the zona </p><p>glomerulosa is different from the regulation of the </p><p>secretion of cortisol and adrenal androgens. Naturally, </p><p>ACTH remains essential in this process because it </p><p>stimulates cholesterol desmolase, the first step in the </p><p>biosynthetic pathway. (Thus ACTH has a tonic effect </p><p>on aldosterone secretion.) Like the other adrenal steroid </p><p>hormones, aldosterone exhibits a diurnal pattern, with </p><p>the lowest levels occurring at midnight and the highest </p><p>levels occurring just before awakening. However, the </p><p>primary regulation of aldosterone secretion occurs not </p><p>by ACTH but through changes in ECF volume via the </p><p>renin–angiotensin II–aldosterone system and through </p><p>changes in serum potassium (K+) levels.</p><p>the anterior pituitary to cause secretion of ACTH. In </p><p>turn, ACTH acts on the cells of the adrenal cortex to </p><p>stimulate the synthesis and secretion of adrenocortical </p><p>hormones.</p><p>♦ CRH is a polypeptide containing 41 amino acids. It is</p><p>secreted by cells of the paraventricular nuclei of the</p><p>hypothalamus. Like other hypothalamic hormones</p><p>that act on the anterior pituitary, CRH travels to</p><p>the pituitary in the hypothalamic-hypophysial portal</p><p>blood. In the anterior lobe, it acts on the cortico-</p><p>trophs by an adenylyl cyclase/cAMP mechanism to</p><p>cause secretion of ACTH into the bloodstream.</p><p>♦ ACTH, the anterior pituitary hormone, has several</p><p>effects on the adrenal cortex. The immediate effects</p><p>of ACTH are to stimulate transfer of stored choles-</p><p>terol to the mitochondria, to stimulate binding of</p><p>cholesterol to cytochrome P-450, and to activate</p><p>cholesterol desmolase. Long-term effects of ACTH</p><p>include stimulation of transcription of the genes for</p><p>cytochrome P-450 and adrenodoxin and up-regulation </p><p>of ACTH receptors. Chronic effects of elevated ACTH</p><p>levels include hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the</p><p>adrenal cortical cells, mediated by local growth</p><p>factors (e.g., IGF-2).</p><p>As noted, ACTH has a pulsatile and diurnal </p><p>secretory pattern that drives a parallel pattern of </p><p>cortisol secretion. The nocturnal peak of ACTH (i.e., </p><p>preceding awakening) is driven, in turn, by a burst </p><p>of CRH secretion. The “internal clock” that drives </p><p>the diurnal pattern can be shifted by alternating the </p><p>sleep-wake cycle (e.g., varying the time of going to </p><p>sleep and awakening). The diurnal pattern is abol-</p><p>ished by coma, blindness, or constant exposure to </p><p>either light or dark.</p><p>♦ Negative feedback is exerted by cortisol at three</p><p>points in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. (1) Cortisol</p><p>directly inhibits secretion of CRH from the hypo-</p><p>thalamus. (2) Cortisol indirectly inhibits CRH secre-</p><p>tion by effects on hippocampal neurons, which</p><p>synapse on the hypothalamus. (3) Cortisol inhibits</p><p>the action of CRH on the anterior pituitary, resulting</p><p>in inhibition of ACTH secretion. Thus chronic defi-</p><p>ciency of cortisol leads to stimulation of the CRH-</p><p>ACTH axis and to increased ACTH levels; chronic</p><p>excess of cortisol leads to inhibition (suppression) of</p><p>the CRH-ACTH axis and decreased ACTH levels.</p><p>♦ The dexamethasone suppression test is based on</p><p>the negative feedback effects of cortisol on the CRH-</p><p>ACTH axis. Dexamethasone is a synthetic glucocor-</p><p>ticoid that has all of the actions of cortisol including</p><p>the negative feedback effect on ACTH secretion.</p><p>When a low dose of dexamethasone is given to a</p><p>healthy person, it inhibits (or “suppresses”) ACTH</p><p>secretion, just as cortisol, the natural glucocorticoid,</p><p>TABLE 9.10 Factors Affecting ACTH Secretion</p><p>Stimulatory Factors</p><p>Inhibitory Factors</p><p>Decreased blood cortisol levels</p><p>Sleep-wake transition</p><p>Stress; hypoglycemia; surgery; </p><p>trauma</p><p>Psychiatric disturbances</p><p>ADH</p><p>α-Adrenergic agonists</p><p>β-Adrenergic antagonists</p><p>Serotonin</p><p>Increased blood </p><p>cortisol levels</p><p>Opioids</p><p>Somatostatin</p><p>ADH, Antidiuretic hormone.</p><p>434 • Physiology</p><p>and stimulates aldosterone secretion. In light of the </p><p>major role that aldosterone plays in maintaining </p><p>K+ balance, the control of aldosterone secretion by </p><p>serum K+ concentration also is logical. For example, </p><p>increases in serum K+ stimulate aldosterone secre-</p><p>tion, and aldosterone increases K+ secretion by the </p><p>kidney, thereby decreasing serum K+ concentration </p><p>toward normal.</p><p>Actions of Adrenocortical Steroids</p><p>Adrenocortical steroids have diverse actions, and the </p><p>actions are classified as glucocorticoid (cortisol), min-</p><p>eralocorticoid (aldosterone), or androgenic (DHEA and </p><p>androstenedione). As steroid hormones, these actions </p><p>first require transcription of DNA, synthesis of specific </p><p>mRNAs, and induction of new protein synthesis. These </p><p>new proteins confer specificity to the steroid hormone </p><p>actions in target tissues (Table 9.11).</p><p>Actions of Glucocorticoids</p><p>Glucocorticoids are essential for life. If the adrenal </p><p>cortex is removed or is not functioning, exogenous </p><p>glucocorticoids must be administered or death will </p><p>ensue. The actions of glucocorticoids (e.g., cortisol) are </p><p>essential for gluconeogenesis, vascular responsiveness </p><p>to catecholamines, suppression of inflammatory and </p><p>immune responses, and modulation of CNS function.</p><p>♦ Stimulation of gluconeogenesis. A major action of</p><p>cortisol is to promote gluconeogenesis and storage of</p><p>glycogen. Overall, the effects of cortisol are catabolic</p><p>and diabetogenic. Cortisol affects protein, fat, and</p><p>carbohydrate metabolism in a coordinated fashion</p><p>to increase glucose synthesis as follows: Cortisol</p><p>increases protein catabolism in muscle and decreases</p><p>new protein synthesis, thereby providing additional</p><p>amino acids to the liver for gluconeogenesis. Cor-</p><p>tisol increases lipolysis, which provides additional</p><p>♦ Renin–angiotensin II–aldosterone. The major con-</p><p>trol of aldosterone secretion is via the renin–</p><p>angiotensin II–aldosterone system. The mediator of</p><p>this regulation is angiotensin II, which increases the</p><p>synthesis and secretion of aldosterone by stimulating</p><p>cholesterol desmolase and aldosterone synthase, the</p><p>first and last steps in the pathway (see Fig. 9.23). In</p><p>the zona glomerulosa, angiotensin II binds to AT1</p><p>receptors that are coupled to phospholipase C via a</p><p>Gq protein. Thus the second messengers for the</p><p>action of angiotensin II are IP3/Ca2+.</p><p>Regulation of the renin–angiotensin II–aldosterone </p><p>axis is described in Chapter 4. Briefly, a decrease in</p><p>ECF volume (e.g., due to hemorrhage or Na+ deple-</p><p>tion) causes a decrease in renal perfusion pressure,</p><p>which increases renin secretion by the juxtaglomeru-</p><p>lar cells of the kidney. Renin, an enzyme, catalyzes</p><p>the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I,</p><p>which is inactive. Angiotensin-converting enzyme</p><p>(ACE) catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to</p><p>angiotensin II, which then acts on the zona glo-</p><p>merulosa to stimulate aldosterone synthesis.</p><p>In light of the role that aldosterone plays in </p><p>maintaining ECF volume, the control of aldosterone</p><p>secretion by the renin–angiotensin II–aldosterone</p><p>system is logical. For example, decreases in ECF</p><p>volume stimulate aldosterone secretion, and aldoste-</p><p>rone stimulates Na+ reabsorption by the kidney to</p><p>help restore ECF Na+ content and ECF volume.</p><p>♦ Serum K+ concentration. The other factor that con-</p><p>trols aldosterone secretion is the serum K+ concen-</p><p>tration. Increases in serum K+ concentration increase</p><p>aldosterone secretion, and decreases in serum K+</p><p>concentration decrease aldosterone secretion. For</p><p>example, an increase in serum K+ concentration acts</p><p>on adrenal cells by depolarizing them and opening</p><p>voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels. When Ca2+ chan-</p><p>nels open, intracellular Ca2+ concentration increases</p><p>TABLE 9.11 Actions of Adrenocortical Steroids</p><p>Actions of Glucocorticoids</p><p>Actions of Mineralocorticoids</p><p>Actions of Adrenal Androgens</p><p>Increase gluconeogenesis</p><p>Increase proteolysis (catabolic)</p><p>Increase lipolysis</p><p>Decrease glucose utilization</p><p>Decrease insulin sensitivity</p><p>Inhibit inflammatory response</p><p>Suppress immune response</p><p>Enhance vascular responsiveness to </p><p>catecholamines</p><p>Inhibit bone formation</p><p>Increase GFR</p><p>Decrease REM sleep</p><p>Increase Na+ reabsorption</p><p>Increase K+ secretion</p><p>Increase H+ secretion</p><p>Females: stimulate growth of pubic and </p><p>axillary hair; stimulate libido</p><p>Males: same as testosterone</p><p>GFR, Glomerular filtration rate; REM, rapid eye movement.</p><p>9—Endocrine Physiology • 435 </p><p>largest bursts of ACTH and cortisol occur just before </p><p>awakening.)</p><p>Actions of Mineralocorticoids</p><p>The actions of mineralocorticoids (e.g., aldosterone) </p><p>are described in detail in Chapter 6. Briefly, aldosterone </p><p>has three actions on the late distal tubule and collecting </p><p>ducts of the kidney: It increases Na+ reabsorption, it </p><p>increases K+ secretion, and it increases H+ secretion. </p><p>Its effects on Na+ reabsorption and K+ secretion are on </p><p>the principal cells, and its effect on H+ secretion is on </p><p>the α-intercalated cells. Thus when aldosterone levels </p><p>are increased (e.g., due to an aldosterone-secreting </p><p>tumor), Na+ reabsorption, K+ secretion, and H+ secre-</p><p>tion all are increased. These changes in renal transport </p><p>result in ECF volume expansion and hypertension, </p><p>hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. Conversely, </p><p>when aldosterone levels are decreased (e.g., due to </p><p>adrenal insufficiency), Na+ reabsorption, K+ secretion, </p><p>and H+ secretion all are decreased. These changes </p><p>produce ECF volume contraction and hypotension, </p><p>hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis.</p><p>An interesting “problem” arises with respect to the </p><p>actions of mineralocorticoids in their target tissues (i.e., </p><p>late distal tubule and collecting ducts of the kidney). </p><p>That is, the affinity of mineralocorticoid receptors for </p><p>cortisol is, surprisingly, just as high as their affinity for </p><p>aldosterone. Because circulating levels of cortisol are </p><p>much higher than circulating levels of aldosterone, it </p><p>seems that cortisol would overwhelm and dominate the </p><p>mineralocorticoid receptors. How would the kidneys </p><p>know that a change in aldosterone concentration had </p><p>occurred and that mineralocorticoid actions are desired? </p><p>The “problem” is solved by the renal cells themselves. </p><p>They contain the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehy-</p><p>drogenase, which converts cortisol to cortisone; in </p><p>contrast to cortisol, cortisone has a low affinity for </p><p>mineralocorticoid receptors. In this way, cortisol is </p><p>effectively inactivated in mineralocorticoid target </p><p>tissues. This unique solution allows changes in blood </p><p>levels of aldosterone to be “seen” by the renal cells and </p><p>not be overshadowed by the high-circulating levels of </p><p>cortisol. This inactivation of cortisol in mineralocorti-</p><p>coid target tissues also explains why, when circulating </p><p>levels of cortisol are high, the cortisol has only weak </p><p>mineralocorticoid activity (despite its high affinity for </p><p>mineralocorticoid receptors).</p><p>Actions of Adrenal Androgens</p><p>The adrenal cortex produces the androgenic com-</p><p>pounds, DHEA and androstenedione, which are con-</p><p>verted to testosterone primarily in the testes. In males, </p><p>adrenal androgens play only a minor role because de </p><p>novo synthesis of testosterone from cholesterol in the </p><p>testes is much greater than testosterone synthesis from </p><p>adrenal androgenic precursors. In females, however, </p><p>glycerol to the liver for gluconeogenesis. Finally, </p><p>cortisol decreases glucose utilization by tissues </p><p>and decreases the insulin sensitivity of adipose </p><p>tissue. Glucocorticoids are essential for survival </p><p>during fasting because they stimulate these gluco-</p><p>neogenic routes. In hypocortisolism (e.g., primary </p><p>adrenal insufficiency, Addison disease), there is </p><p>hypoglycemia. In hypercortisolism (e.g., Cushing </p><p>syndrome), there is hyperglycemia.</p><p>♦ Anti-inflammatory effects. Cortisol has three actions </p><p>that interfere with the body’s inflammatory response</p><p>to trauma and irritants. (1) Cortisol induces the</p><p>synthesis of lipocortin, an inhibitor of the enzyme</p><p>phospholipase A2. Phospholipase A2 liberates arachi-</p><p>donic acid from membrane phospholipids and pro-</p><p>vides the precursor for the prostaglandins and</p><p>leukotrienes that mediate the inflammatory response. </p><p>Therefore this component of the anti-inflammatory</p><p>effect of cortisol is based on inhibiting the synthesis</p><p>of the precursor to prostaglandins and leukotrienes.</p><p>(2) Cortisol inhibits the production of interleukin-2</p><p>(IL-2) and the proliferation of T lymphocytes. (3)</p><p>Cortisol inhibits the release of histamine and sero-</p><p>tonin from mast cells and platelets.</p><p>♦ Suppression of immune response. As previously</p><p>noted, cortisol inhibits the production of IL-2 and</p><p>the proliferation of T lymphocytes, which also are</p><p>critical for cellular immunity. Exogenous glucocorti-</p><p>coids can be administered therapeutically to sup-</p><p>press the immune response and prevent the rejection</p><p>of transplanted organs.</p><p>♦ Maintenance </p><p>of </p><p>vascular </p><p>responsiveness </p><p>to</p><p>catecholamines. Cortisol is necessary for the</p><p>maintenance of normal blood pressure and plays</p><p>a permissive role in the arterioles by up-regulating</p><p>α1-adrenergic receptors. In this way, cortisol is</p><p>required for the vasoconstrictive response of the</p><p>arterioles to catecholamines. In hypocortisolism,</p><p>there is hypotension; in hypercortisolism, there is</p><p>hypertension.</p><p>♦ Inhibition of bone formation. Cortisol inhibits bone</p><p>formation by decreasing the synthesis of type I col-</p><p>lagen, the major component of bone matrix; by</p><p>decreasing formation of new bone by osteoblasts;</p><p>and by decreasing intestinal Ca2+ absorption.</p><p>♦ Increases in glomerular filtration rate (GFR).</p><p>Cortisol increases GFR by causing vasodilation of</p><p>afferent arterioles, thereby increasing renal blood</p><p>flow and GFR.</p><p>♦ Effects on CNS. Glucocorticoid receptors are found</p><p>in the brain, particularly in the limbic system. Cor-</p><p>tisol decreases REM sleep, increases slow-wave</p><p>sleep, and increases awake time. (Recall that the</p><p>436 • Physiology</p><p>secondary effect on the adrenal cortex. The etiology </p><p>of the disorder may not be deduced until circulating </p><p>levels of CRH and ACTH are measured and the </p><p>feedback regulation of the CRH-ACTH axis is </p><p>evaluated.</p><p>For disorders caused by enzyme deficiencies in the </p><p>steroid hormone biosynthetic pathway, the pathways </p><p>can be visualized to predict the effects of a given </p><p>enzyme block (see Fig. 9.23). For example, a woman </p><p>with masculinization also has symptoms consistent </p><p>with aldosterone deficiency (e.g., hyperkalemia) </p><p>and cortisol deficiency (e.g., hypoglycemia). This </p><p>constellation of symptoms suggests that there is an </p><p>enzyme block preventing the synthesis of all miner-</p><p>alocorticoids and all glucocorticoids (e.g., deficiency </p><p>of 21β-hydroxylase). Because of the block, steroid </p><p>intermediates are “shunted” toward androgen pro-</p><p>duction and the increased adrenal androgen levels </p><p>cause masculinization. To understand the patho-</p><p>physiology of the adrenal cortex, use the biosynthetic </p><p>pathway shown in Figure 9.23 in combination with </p><p>the actions of the steroid hormones summarized in </p><p>Table 9.11. The features of each disorder are sum-</p><p>marized in Table 9.12.</p><p>Addison Disease</p><p>Addison disease, or primary adrenocortical insuffi-</p><p>ciency, is commonly caused by autoimmune destruc-</p><p>tion of all zones of the adrenal cortex (Box 9.2). In this </p><p>disease, there is decreased synthesis of all adrenocorti-</p><p>cal hormones, resulting in decreased circulating levels </p><p>of cortisol, aldosterone, and adrenal androgens. The </p><p>symptoms of Addison disease can be predicted on the </p><p>basis of the known physiologic effects of these hor-</p><p>mones. The loss of glucocorticoids (cortisol) produces </p><p>hypoglycemia, anorexia, weight loss, nausea and </p><p>vomiting, and weakness. The loss of mineralocorticoids </p><p>(aldosterone) produces hyperkalemia, metabolic acido-</p><p>sis, and hypotension (due to decreased ECF volume). </p><p>In women, the loss of the adrenal androgens, DHEA </p><p>and androstenedione, results in decreased pubic and </p><p>axillary hair and decreased libido.</p><p>Addison disease also is characterized by hyper-</p><p>pigmentation of the skin, particularly of the elbows, </p><p>knees, nail beds, nipples, and areolae and on recent </p><p>scars. Hyperpigmentation is a result of increased levels </p><p>of ACTH (which contains the α-MSH fragment). Hyper-</p><p>pigmentation therefore provides an important clue </p><p>about the etiology of Addison disease: ACTH levels </p><p>must be high, not low, and the cause of the hypocorti-</p><p>solism must not be a primary defect in ACTH secretion </p><p>from the anterior pituitary. Rather, the hypocortisolism </p><p>of Addison disease must be due to a primary defect in </p><p>the adrenal cortex itself (i.e., primary adrenal insuf-</p><p>ficiency), with low levels of cortisol then causing an </p><p>adrenal androgens are the major androgens, and they </p><p>are responsible for the development of pubic and axil-</p><p>lary hair and for libido.</p><p>In conditions such as adrenogenital syndrome, in </p><p>which there is increased synthesis of adrenal andro-</p><p>gens, the high levels of DHEA and androstenedione </p><p>lead to masculinization in females, early development </p><p>of axillary and pubic hair, and suppression of gonadal </p><p>function in both males and females. Also, in the adre-</p><p>nogenital syndromes, due to the overproduction of </p><p>adrenal androgens, there will be increased urinary </p><p>levels of 17-ketosteroids.</p><p>Pathophysiology of the Adrenal Cortex</p><p>Disorders involving the adrenal cortex are character-</p><p>ized by either an excess or a deficiency of adrenocortical </p><p>hormones. When evaluating the pathophysiology of </p><p>these disorders, it is helpful to consider the following </p><p>issues:</p><p>1. What are the symptoms and signs? Are the signs and</p><p>symptoms consistent with an excess or a deficiency</p><p>of one or more of the adrenocortical hormones? The</p><p>normal physiologic effects of each of the adrenocor-</p><p>tical hormones can be used to predict the effects of</p><p>hormonal excess or deficiency (see Table 9.11). A</p><p>few examples are cited here.</p><p>Cortisol promotes gluconeogenesis, and therefore, </p><p>excess levels of cortisol will produce hyperglycemia; </p><p>deficits of cortisol will produce hypoglycemia upon </p><p>fasting. Aldosterone causes increased K+ secretion </p><p>by the renal principal cells; thus excess aldosterone </p><p>will cause increased K+ secretion and hypokalemia, </p><p>and deficiency of aldosterone will cause decreased K+ </p><p>secretion and hyperkalemia. Aldosterone also causes </p><p>increased Na+ reabsorption by the principal cells; </p><p>thus excess aldosterone causes ECF volume expan-</p><p>sion and hypertension, and deficiency of aldosterone </p><p>causes ECF volume contraction and hypotension. </p><p>Because adrenal androgens have testosterone-like </p><p>effects, overproduction causes masculinization in </p><p>females (e.g., hirsutism); deficits of adrenal andro-</p><p>gens result in loss of pubic and axillary hair and </p><p>decreased libido in females.</p><p>2. What is the etiology of the disorder? Disorders of the</p><p>adrenal cortex can be caused by a primary defect in</p><p>the adrenal cortex or by a primary defect in the</p><p>hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Or, in the case of aldo-</p><p>sterone, the defect may be in the renin–angiotensin</p><p>II axis. For example, symptoms consistent with</p><p>overproduction of an adrenocortical hormone (e.g.,</p><p>hypercortisolism) may be caused by a primary defect</p><p>in the adrenal cortex. Or, the symptoms may be</p><p>caused by a primary defect in the anterior pituitary</p><p>or the hypothalamus, which then produces a</p><p>9—Endocrine Physiology • 437 </p><p>decreases cortisol secretion by the adrenal cortex. </p><p>The cortisol deficiency then produces many of the </p><p>symptoms that occur in primary adrenocortical insuf-</p><p>ficiency (e.g., hypoglycemia). There are, however, </p><p>several distinctions between primary and secondary </p><p>adrenocortical insufficiency. (1) In secondary adreno-</p><p>cortical insufficiency, ACTH levels are low, not high.  </p><p>(2) In secondary adrenocortical insufficiency, aldosterone </p><p>levels usually are normal because aldosterone synthesis </p><p>by the zona glomerulosa requires only tonic levels of </p><p>ACTH.

A 45-year-old woman is </p><p>admitted to the hospital with a history of progressive </p><p>weakness and weight loss, occasional nausea, and </p><p>darkening skin pigmentation. On physical examination, </p><p>she is thin, has dark skin creases, and has diminished </p><p>axillary and pubic hair. Her blood pressure is 120/80 </p><p>when supine and 106/50 when standing. Her pulse rate </p><p>is 100/minute when supine and 120/minute when </p><p>standing. Laboratory studies yield the following values:</p><p>Serum</p><p>Urine</p><p>[Na+], 120 mEq/L</p><p>Na+, increased</p><p>[K+], 5.8 mEq/L</p><p>K+, decreased</p><p>[HCO3</p><p>−], 120 mEq/L</p><p>pH, increased</p><p>Osmolarity, 254 mOsm/L</p><p>Osmolarity, 450 mOsm/L</p><p>Arterial blood gases are consistent with metabolic </p><p>acidosis. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creati-</p><p>nine are increased. Her blood glucose concentration is </p><p>low-normal, and she becomes hypoglycemic upon </p><p>fasting. Serum levels of ACTH are elevated. An ACTH </p><p>stimulation test shows a “flat” cortisol response (i.e., </p><p>the adrenal cortex did not respond to ACTH).</p><p>The woman is treated with cortisol, taken twice </p><p>daily, early morning and late afternoon, and fludrocor-</p><p>tisone, a synthetic mineralocorticoid.</p><p>EXPLANATION OF CASE. The woman has primary </p><p>adrenocortical insufficiency (Addison disease), in </p><p>which all layers of the adrenal cortex are destroyed. </p><p>None of the adrenocortical hormones, glucocorti-</p><p>coids, mineralocorticoids, and adrenal androgens are </p><p>secreted in adequate amounts. Decreased blood levels </p><p>of cortisol, via negative feedback mechanisms, then </p><p>cause increased secretion of ACTH by the anterior lobe </p><p>of the pituitary. The woman’s abnormal serum and </p><p>urine values, orthostatic hypotension, hypoglycemia, </p><p>decreased body hair, and hyperpigmentation can be </p><p>explained by decreased circulating levels of adrenocor-</p><p>tical steroids as follows:</p><p>The woman has increased serum [K+] (hyperkale-</p><p>mia) and metabolic acidosis. Simultaneously, urinary </p><p>excretion of K+ is decreased, and urine pH is increased. </p><p>These disturbances of K+ and acid-base balance are </p><p>caused by the loss of the adrenocortical hormone </p><p>aldosterone. Normally, aldosterone stimulates K+ and </p><p>H+ secretion in the renal distal tubule and collecting </p><p>duct. Therefore when there is a deficiency of aldoste-</p><p>rone, the kidney secretes inadequate amounts of K+ and </p><p>H+, elevating their respective blood levels and causing </p><p>hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis. (Accordingly, the </p><p>excretion of K+ and H+ in urine is decreased.)</p><p>When the woman moves from a supine to a standing </p><p>position, her blood pressure decreases and her pulse </p><p>rate increases. Orthostatic hypotension, the decrease </p><p>in blood pressure upon standing, is explained by a </p><p>deficiency of aldosterone and a deficiency of cortisol. In </p><p>addition to its effects on K+ and H+ secretion, aldosterone </p><p>stimulates renal Na+ reabsorption. When aldosterone is </p><p>deficient, there is inadequate renal Na+ reabsorption, </p><p>which results in decreased body Na+ content, decreased </p><p>ECF volume and blood volume, and decreased arte-</p><p>rial blood pressure (especially when standing). Lack </p><p>of cortisol contributes to her hypotension by reduc-</p><p>ing vascular responsiveness to catecholamines. The </p><p>increased pulse rate upon standing reflects the response </p><p>of the baroreceptor reflex to this orthostatic decrease </p><p>in blood pressure. A component of the baroreceptor </p><p>reflex response is increased heart rate, which attempts </p><p>to restore blood pressure back to normal. The woman’s </p><p>elevated BUN and serum creatinine reflect a decreased </p><p>GFR, which is consistent with decreased ECF volume </p><p>(i.e., prerenal azotemia).</p><p>The woman’s decreased serum [Na+] and serum </p><p>osmolarity are secondary to the ECF volume contrac-</p><p>tion. When ECF volume decreases by 10% or more, </p><p>ADH secretion is stimulated. ADH then circulates to the </p><p>kidney, stimulating water reabsorption, as reflected in </p><p>the hyperosmotic urine. The reabsorbed water is added </p><p>to the body fluids, diluting them, as reflected in the </p><p>decreased [Na+] and osmolarity. ADH secreted under </p><p>such hypovolemic conditions is quite appropriate for </p><p>her volume status but inappropriate for her serum </p><p>osmolarity.</p><p>Hypoglycemia, nausea, weight loss, and weakness </p><p>are caused by a deficiency of glucocorticoids. The </p><p>decreased body Na+ content and decreased ECF volume </p><p>also contribute to weight loss because a large percent-</p><p>age of body weight is water.</p><p>Hyperpigmentation resulted from negative feedback </p><p>on the anterior pituitary by the low circulating cortisol </p><p>levels. The decreased levels of cortisol stimulate secre-</p><p>tion of ACTH, which contains the α-MSH fragment. </p><p>When circulating levels of ACTH are elevated, as in </p><p>Addison disease, the α-MSH component of the molecule </p><p>produces darkening skin pigmentation.</p><p>The woman has decreased pubic and axillary hair </p><p>from the loss of the adrenal androgens, DHEA and </p><p>androstenedione.

Hypertension occurs </p><p>because cortisol has weak mineralocorticoid activity </p><p>and because cortisol increases the responsiveness of </p><p>arterioles to catecholamines (by up-regulating α1 recep-</p><p>tors). Excess androgens cause virilization and menstrual </p><p>disorders in females.</p><p>Cushing syndrome and Cushing disease exhibit </p><p>similar clinical features, but they differ in the circulat-</p><p>ing levels of ACTH. In Cushing syndrome, the primary </p><p>defect is in the adrenal cortex, which is overproducing </p><p>cortisol. Accordingly, ACTH levels are low because the </p><p>high cortisol levels feed back on the anterior pituitary </p><p>and inhibit ACTH secretion. In Cushing disease, the </p><p>primary defect is in the anterior pituitary, which is </p><p>overproducing ACTH; ACTH levels are elevated. As </p><p>already described, the dexamethasone suppression </p><p>test, in which a synthetic glucocorticoid is adminis-</p><p>tered, can distinguish between the two disorders. In </p><p>Cushing syndrome (primary adrenal defect with a </p><p>normal CRH-ACTH axis), because the adrenal tumor </p><p>functions autonomously, cortisol secretion is not sup-</p><p>pressed by either low- or high-dose dexamethasone. In </p><p>Cushing disease, ACTH and cortisol secretion are sup-</p><p>pressed by high-dose dexamethasone but not by low-</p><p>dose dexamethasone.</p><p>Treatment of Cushing syndrome includes administra-</p><p>tion of drugs such as ketoconazole or metyrapone, </p><p>which block steroid hormone biosynthesis. If drug </p><p>treatment is ineffective, then bilateral adrenalectomy </p><p>coupled with steroid hormone replacement may be </p><p>required. Because of its different etiology, treatment of </p><p>Cushing disease involves surgical removal of the ACTH-</p><p>secreting tumor.</p><p>Conn Syndrome</p><p>Conn syndrome, or primary hyperaldosteronism, is </p><p>caused by an aldosterone-secreting tumor. The symp-</p><p>toms of Conn syndrome are explainable by the known </p><p>physiologic actions of aldosterone: Na+ reabsorption, K+ </p><p>secretion, and H+ secretion. The effects of excess aldo-</p><p>sterone are increased ECF volume and hypertension </p><p>(due to increased Na+ reabsorption), hypokalemia (due </p><p>to increased K+ secretion), and metabolic alkalosis (due </p><p>to increased H+ secretion). In Conn syndrome, circulat-</p><p>ing renin levels are decreased because the increased </p><p>ECF volume (caused by high levels of aldosterone) </p><p>increases renal perfusion pressure, which inhibits renin </p><p>secretion. Treatment of Conn syndrome consists of </p><p>administration of an aldosterone antagonist such as </p><p>spironolactone, followed by surgical removal of the </p><p>aldosterone-secreting tumor.</p><p>21β-Hydroxylase Deficiency</p><p>Several congenital abnormalities are associated with </p><p>enzyme defects in the steroid hormone biosynthetic </p><p>metabolic acidosis, and ECF volume contraction are not </p><p>present. (3) In secondary adrenocortical insufficiency, </p><p>hyperpigmentation does not occur because levels of </p><p>ACTH (containing the α-MSH fragment) are low, not </p><p>high as occurs in Addison disease.</p><p>Cushing Syndrome</p><p>Cushing syndrome is the result of chronic excess of </p><p>glucocorticoids. It can be caused by spontaneous over-</p><p>production of cortisol by the adrenal cortex or from the </p><p>administration of pharmacologic doses of exogenous </p><p>glucocorticoids. Cushing disease is a separate entity, </p><p>also characterized by excess glucocorticoids, in which </p><p>the cause is hypersecretion of ACTH from a pituitary </p><p>adenoma (which then drives the adrenal cortex to </p><p>secrete excess cortisol).</p><p>The symptoms of either Cushing syndrome or </p><p>Cushing disease are the result of excessive glucocorti-</p><p>coids and adrenal androgens (Fig. 9.26). Excess cortisol </p><p>causes hyperglycemia, increased proteolysis and muscle </p><p>wasting, increased lipolysis and thin extremities, central </p><p>obesity, round face, supraclavicular fat, buffalo hump, </p><p>Fig. 9.26 Drawing of a woman with Cushing disease. Note </p><p>the central obesity, buffalo hump, muscle wasting, and striae. </p><p>440 • Physiology</p><p>answer lies in the feedback regulation of the renin–</p><p>angiotensin II–aldosterone system. The increased levels </p><p>of DOC and corticosterone cause symptoms of miner-</p><p>alocorticoid excess: hypertension, metabolic alkalosis, </p><p>and hypokalemia. Hypertension inhibits renin secre-</p><p>tion, thus leading to decreased levels of angiotensin II </p><p>and aldosterone; hypokalemia also inhibits aldosterone </p><p>secretion directly.</p><p>ENDOCRINE PANCREAS</p><p>The endocrine pancreas secretes two major peptide </p><p>hormones, insulin and glucagon, whose coordinated </p><p>functions are to regulate glucose, fatty acid, and amino </p><p>acid metabolism. The endocrine pancreas also secretes </p><p>somatostatin and pancreatic polypeptide, whose func-</p><p>tions are less well established.</p><p>The endocrine cells of the pancreas are arranged in </p><p>clusters called the islets of Langerhans, which compose </p><p>1% to 2% of the pancreatic mass. There are approxi-</p><p>mately 1 million islets of Langerhans, each containing </p><p>about 2500 cells. The islets of Langerhans contain four </p><p>cell types, and each cell secretes a different hormone </p><p>or peptide (Fig. 9.27). The β cells compose 65% of the </p><p>islet and secrete insulin. The α cells compose 20% of </p><p>the islet and secrete glucagon. The delta (δ) cells </p><p>compose 10% of the islet and secrete somatostatin. </p><p>The remaining cells (not shown in Fig. 9.27) secrete </p><p>pancreatic polypeptide or other peptides.</p><p>The central core of the islet of Langerhans contains </p><p>mostly β cells, with α cells distributed around the outer </p><p>rim. The δ cells are interposed between α and β cells, </p><p>pathways. The most common enzymatic defect is </p><p>deficiency of 21β-hydroxylase, which belongs to a </p><p>group of disorders called adrenogenital syndrome. </p><p>Review Figure 9.23 to understand the consequences </p><p>of this enzyme deficiency. Without 21β-hydroxylase, </p><p>the adrenal cortex is unable to convert progesterone </p><p>to DOC or to convert 17-hydroxyprogesterone to 11- </p><p>deoxycortisol. In other words, the adrenal cortex does </p><p>not synthesize mineralocorticoids or glucocorticoids, </p><p>resulting in predictable symptoms (as previously dis-</p><p>cussed). Steroid intermediates will accumulate above </p><p>the enzyme block and be shunted toward production </p><p>of the adrenal androgens, DHEA and androstenedi-</p><p>one, which then cause virilization in females. There </p><p>will be increased urinary levels of 17-ketosteroids. If </p><p>the defect is present in utero in a female fetus, the </p><p>excess androgens cause masculinization of the external </p><p>genitalia, with a penis-like clitoris and scrotum-like </p><p>labia. If untreated in childhood, the androgen excess </p><p>will cause an acceleration of linear growth, the early </p><p>appearance of pubic and axillary hair, and suppres-</p><p>sion of gonadal function. ACTH levels will be elevated </p><p>because of negative feedback on the anterior pituitary </p><p>by the low cortisol levels, and these high ACTH levels </p><p>will have a trophic effect on the adrenal cortex and </p><p>cause adrenocortical hyperplasia. (Thus the other </p><p>name for this group of disorders is congenital adrenal </p><p>hyperplasia.) Treatment of 21β-hydroxylase deficiency </p><p>consists of replacement of both glucocorticoids and </p><p>mineralocorticoids.</p><p>17α-Hydroxylase Deficiency</p><p>A less common congenital abnormality of the steroid </p><p>hormone biosynthetic pathway is deficiency of 17α- </p><p>hydroxylase. The consequences of this defect differ </p><p>from those of 21β-hydroxylase deficiency. Examination </p><p>of Figure 9.23 shows that without 17α-hydroxylase, </p><p>pregnenolone cannot be converted to 17-hydroxypreg-</p><p>nenolone and progesterone cannot be converted to </p><p>17-hydroxyprogesterone. As a result, neither gluco-</p><p>corticoids nor adrenal androgens will be produced  </p><p>by the adrenal cortex. The absence of cortisol will </p><p>cause predictable effects (e.g., hypoglycemia), and the </p><p>absence of adrenal androgens will result in the lack of </p><p>pubic and axillary hair in females. In this disorder, </p><p>steroid intermediates accumulate to the left of the </p><p>enzyme block and will be shunted toward mineralocor-</p><p>ticoids; there will be overproduction of DOC and corti-</p><p>costerone, both of which have mineralocorticoid </p><p>activity. The resulting high levels of mineralocorticoids </p><p>then cause hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic </p><p>alkalosis.</p><p>Interestingly, the levels of aldosterone itself are actu-</p><p>ally decreased in 17α-hydroxylase deficiency. Why </p><p>would this be so, if steroid intermediates are shunted </p><p>toward the production of mineralocorticoids?

(1) Gap junctions connect α cells to each other, </p><p>β cells to each other, and α cells to β cells. These gap </p><p>junctions permit rapid cell-to-cell communication via </p><p>either ionic current flow or transfer of molecules (up </p><p>to 1000 molecular weight). (2) The islets receive about </p><p>10% of the total pancreatic blood flow. The blood </p><p>supply of the endocrine pancreas is arranged so that </p><p>venous blood from one cell type bathes the other cell </p><p>types. Small arteries enter the core of the islet, distrib-</p><p>uting blood through a network of fenestrated capillaries </p><p>and then converging into venules that carry the blood </p><p>to the rim of the islet. Thus venous blood from the β </p><p>cells carries insulin to the α and δ cells. (3) The islets </p><p>are innervated by adrenergic, cholinergic, and peptide-</p><p>rgic neurons. The δ cells even have a “neuronal” </p><p>appearance and send dendrite-like processes onto the </p><p>β cells, suggesting intraislet neural communication.</p><p>Insulin</p><p>Insulin, which is synthesized and secreted by the  </p><p>β cells, boasts an impressive array of “firsts.” It was </p><p>the first hormone to be isolated from animal sources in </p><p>a form that could be administered therapeutically to </p><p>humans; the first hormone to have its primary and </p><p>tertiary structure determined; the first hormone to have </p><p>its mechanism of action elucidated; the first hormone </p><p>to be measured by radioimmunoassay; the first hormone </p><p>known to be synthesized from a larger precursor (pro-</p><p>hormone); and the first hormone to be synthesized </p><p>with recombinant DNA technology.</p><p>Structure and Synthesis of Insulin</p><p>Insulin is a peptide hormone consisting of two straight </p><p>chains, an A chain (21 amino acids) and a B chain (30 </p><p>amino acids). Two disulfide bridges link the A chain to </p><p>the B chain, and a third disulfide bridge is located </p><p>within the A chain.</p><p>The synthesis of insulin is directed by a gene on </p><p>chromosome 11, a member of a superfamily of genes </p><p>that encode related growth factors. The mRNA directs </p><p>ribosomal synthesis of preproinsulin, which contains </p><p>four peptides: a signal peptide, the A and B chains of </p><p>insulin, and a connecting peptide (C peptide). The signal </p><p>peptide is cleaved early in the biosynthetic process </p><p>(while the peptide chains are still being assembled), </p><p>yielding proinsulin (Fig. 9.28). Proinsulin is then </p><p>shuttled to the endoplasmic reticulum, where, with </p><p>the connecting peptide still attached, disulfide bridges </p><p>form to yield a “folded” form of insulin. Proinsulin is </p><p>packaged in secretory granules on the Golgi apparatus. </p><p>During this packaging process, proteases cleave the </p><p>connecting peptide, yielding insulin.</p><p>Insulin and the cleaved connecting peptide are pack-</p><p>aged together in secretory granules, and when the β </p><p>cell is stimulated, they are released in equimolar </p><p>quantities into the blood. The secretion of connecting </p><p>peptide (C peptide) is the basis of a test for β cell </p><p>function in persons with type I diabetes mellitus who </p><p>are receiving injections of exogenous insulin. (In these </p><p>persons, serum insulin levels do not reflect endogenous </p><p>secretory rates.)</p><p>Insulin is metabolized in the liver and kidney by </p><p>enzymes that break disulfide bonds. The A chains and </p><p>B chains are released, now inactive, and are excreted </p><p>in the urine.</p><p>Regulation of Insulin Secretion</p><p>Table 9.13 summarizes the factors that influence the </p><p>secretion of insulin by β cells.

The α sub-</p><p>units lie in the extracellular domain, and the β subunits </p><p>span the cell membrane. A disulfide bond connects the </p><p>two α subunits, and each α subunit is connected to a </p><p>β subunit by a disulfide bond. The β subunits have </p><p>intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity.</p><p>Insulin acts on its target cells, as described in the </p><p>following steps:</p><p>1. Insulin binds to the α subunits of the tetrameric</p><p>insulin receptor, producing a conformational change</p><p>in the receptor. The conformational change activates</p><p>tyrosine kinase in the β subunits, which phosphory-</p><p>late themselves in the presence of ATP. In other</p><p>words, the β subunits autophosphorylate.</p><p>2. Activated tyrosine kinase phosphorylates several</p><p>other proteins or enzymes that are involved in the</p><p>physiologic actions of insulin including protein</p><p>kinases, phosphatases, phospholipases, and G pro-</p><p>teins. Phosphorylation either activates or inhibits</p><p>these proteins to produce the various metabolic</p><p>actions of insulin.</p><p>3. The insulin-receptor complex is internalized (i.e.,</p><p>taken in) by its target cell by endocytosis. The insulin</p><p>receptor is either degraded by intracellular proteases,</p><p>stored, or recycled to the cell membrane to be used</p><p>again. Insulin down-regulates its own receptor by</p><p>decreasing the rate of synthesis and increasing the</p><p>rate of degradation of the receptor. Down-regulation</p><p>of the insulin receptor is in part responsible for the</p><p>decreased insulin sensitivity of target tissues in</p><p>obesity and type II diabetes mellitus.</p><p>In addition to the previously described actions,</p><p>insulin also binds to elements in the nucleus, the Golgi </p><p>apparatus, and the endoplasmic reticulum.

When the availability of nutrients exceeds the </p><p>demands of the body, insulin ensures that excess </p><p>nutrients are stored as glycogen in the liver, as fat in </p><p>adipose tissue, and as protein in muscle. These stored </p><p>nutrients are then available during subsequent periods </p><p>of fasting to maintain glucose delivery to the brain, </p><p>muscle, and other organs.

As a result, insulin decreases the circulat-</p><p>ing levels of fatty acids and ketoacids. In adipose</p><p>tissue, insulin stimulates fat deposition and inhibits</p><p>lipolysis. Simultaneously, insulin inhibits ketoacid</p><p>(β-hydroxybutyric acid and acetoacetic acid) forma-</p><p>tion in liver because decreased fatty acid degradation</p><p>means that less acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA)</p><p>substrate will be available for the formation of</p><p>ketoacids.</p><p>♦ Decreases blood amino acid concentration. The</p><p>overall effect of insulin on protein metabolism is</p><p>anabolic. Insulin increases amino acid and protein</p><p>uptake by tissues, thereby decreasing blood levels of</p><p>amino acids. Insulin stimulates amino acid uptake</p><p>into target cells (e.g., muscle), increases protein</p><p>synthesis, and inhibits protein degradation.</p><p>♦ Other actions. In addition to major actions on car-</p><p>bohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism, insulin has</p><p>several additional effects. Insulin promotes K+</p><p>uptake into cells (at the same time that it promotes</p><p>glucose uptake) by increasing the activity of the</p><p>Na+-K+ ATPase. This action of insulin can be viewed</p><p>as “protecting” against an increase in serum K+</p><p>concentration. When K+ is ingested in the diet,</p><p>insulin ensures that ingested K+ will be taken into</p><p>the cells with glucose and other nutrients. Insulin</p><p>Insulin has the following actions on liver, muscle, and </p><p>adipose tissue:</p><p>♦ Decreases blood glucose concentration. The hypo-</p><p>glycemic action of insulin can be described in two</p><p>ways: Insulin causes a frank decrease in blood glucose </p><p>concentration, and insulin limits the rise in blood</p><p>glucose that occurs after ingestion of carbohydrates.</p><p>The hypoglycemic action of insulin is the result of</p><p>coordinated responses that simultaneously stimulate</p><p>glucose oxidation and inhibit gluconeogenesis as</p><p>follows: (1) Insulin increases glucose transport into</p><p>target cells such as muscle and adipose by directing</p><p>the insertion of glucose transporters (GLUT4) into</p><p>the cell membranes. As glucose enters the cells, the</p><p>blood glucose concentration decreases.

The increased </p><p>levels of ketoacids cause a form of metabolic acidosis </p><p>called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The increased </p><p>blood glucose concentration results in an increased </p><p>filtered load of glucose, which exceeds the reabsorp-</p><p>tive capacity of the proximal tubule. The nonreab-</p><p>sorbed glucose then acts as an osmotic solute in </p><p>urine, producing an osmotic diuresis, polyuria, and </p><p>thirst. The polyuria produces ECF volume contrac-</p><p>tion and hypotension.

Coor-</p><p>dinating with this stimulatory effect of low blood </p><p>glucose is a separate inhibitory action of insulin. Thus </p><p>the presence of insulin reduces or modulates the effect </p><p>of low blood glucose concentration to stimulate gluca-</p><p>gon secretion. In the absence of insulin (i.e., type I </p><p>diabetes mellitus), however, the glucagon response to </p><p>hypoglycemia is exaggerated and may lead to severe, </p><p>perpetuated hyperglycemia.</p><p>Glucagon secretion also is stimulated by the inges-</p><p>tion of protein, specifically by the amino acids arginine </p><p>and alanine. The response of the α cells to amino acids </p><p>is blunted if glucose is administered simultaneously </p><p>(partially mediated by the inhibitory effect of insulin </p><p>on glucagon secretion). Thus glucose and amino acids </p><p>have offsetting or opposite effects on glucagon secre-</p><p>tion (in contrast to their effects on insulin secretion, </p><p>which are complementary).</p><p>Other factors stimulating glucagon secretion are </p><p>cholecystokinin (CCK), which is secreted from the </p><p>gastrointestinal tract when protein or fat is ingested, </p><p>and fasting and intense exercise. Some of the stimula-</p><p>tory effects on glucagon secretion are mediated by </p><p>activation of sympathetic α-adrenergic receptors.</p><p>Actions of Glucagon</p><p>The mechanism of action of glucagon on its target cells </p><p>begins with hormone binding to a cell membrane </p><p>receptor, which is coupled to adenylyl cyclase via a  </p><p>Gs protein. The second messenger is cAMP, which </p><p>activates protein kinases that phosphorylate various </p><p>enzymes; the phosphorylated enzymes then mediate </p><p>the physiologic actions of glucagon.</p><p>As the hormone of starvation, glucagon promotes </p><p>mobilization and utilization of stored nutrients to </p><p>maintain the blood glucose concentration in the fasting </p><p>state. The major actions of glucagon are on the liver </p><p>(in contrast to insulin, which acts on liver, adipose, and </p><p>muscle tissue). The effects of glucagon on the flow of </p><p>nutrients are illustrated in Figure 9.32. Glucagon has </p><p>ability of the body to store carbohydrates, lipids, and </p><p>proteins and returns the blood values of nutrients </p><p>and electrolytes to normal.</p><p>♦ Non–insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, or type</p><p>II diabetes mellitus, is often associated with obesity.</p><p>It exhibits some, but not all, of the metabolic</p><p>derangements seen in type I diabetes mellitus. Type</p><p>II diabetes mellitus is caused by down-regulation of</p><p>insulin receptors in target tissues and insulin resis-</p><p>tance. Insulin is secreted normally by the β cells,</p><p>but at normal concentrations, it cannot activate its</p><p>receptors on muscle, liver, and adipose tissue; thus</p><p>insulin is unable to produce its usual metabolic</p><p>effects. Typically, the blood glucose concentration is</p><p>elevated in both fasting and postprandial (after</p><p>eating) states. Treatment of type II diabetes mellitus</p><p>includes caloric restriction and weight reduction;</p><p>treatment with sulfonylurea drugs (e.g., tolbuta-</p><p>mide or glyburide), which stimulate pancreatic</p><p>insulin secretion; and treatment with biguanide</p><p>drugs (e.g., metformin), which up-regulate insulin</p><p>receptors on target tissues.</p><p>Glucagon</p><p>Glucagon is synthesized and secreted by the α cells of </p><p>the islets of Langerhans. In most respects (i.e., regula-</p><p>tion of secretion, actions, and effect on blood levels), </p><p>glucagon is the “mirror image” of insulin. Thus while </p><p>insulin is the hormone of “abundance,” glucagon is the </p><p>hormone of “starvation.” In contrast to insulin, which </p><p>promotes storage of metabolic fuels, glucagon promotes </p><p>their mobilization and utilization.</p><p>Structure and Synthesis of Glucagon</p><p>Glucagon is a single straight-chain polypeptide with 29 </p><p>amino acids. It is a member of a family of peptides that </p><p>includes the gastrointestinal hormones secretin and </p><p>GIP. All of the peptides in the family share structural </p><p>features and overlap in their physiologic actions (see </p><p>Chapter 8, Fig. 8.6).</p><p>As with other peptide hormones, glucagon is syn-</p><p>thesized as preproglucagon. The signal peptide and </p><p>other peptide sequences are removed to produce glu-</p><p>cagon, which then is stored in dense granules until it </p><p>is secreted by the α cells. Both glucose and insulin </p><p>inhibit the synthesis of glucagon; insulin-sensitive and </p><p>cAMP-sensitive elements are present on the gene for </p><p>preproglucagon.</p><p>Regulation of Glucagon Secretion</p><p>The actions of glucagon are coordinated to increase and </p><p>maintain the blood glucose concentration. Thus the </p><p>factors that cause stimulation of glucagon secretion are </p><p>those that inform the α cells that a decrease in blood </p><p>glucose has occurred (Table 9.15).</p><p>TABLE 9.15 Factors Affecting Glucagon Secretion</p><p>Stimulatory Factors</p><p>Inhibitory Factors</p><p>Fasting</p><p>Decreased glucose </p><p>concentration</p><p>Increased amino acid </p><p>concentration </p><p>(especially arginine)</p><p>Cholecystokinin (CCK)</p><p>β-Adrenergic agonists</p><p>Acetylcholine</p><p>Insulin</p><p>Somatostatin</p><p>Increased fatty acid and </p><p>ketoacid concentration</p><p>9—Endocrine Physiology • 447 </p><p>fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, which decreases phos-</p><p>phofructokinase activity.

This discussion </p><p>of the effects of hypocalcemia refers to low extracellular </p><p>Ca2+. Decreased extracellular Ca2+ causes increased </p><p>excitability of excitable cells including sensory and </p><p>motor nerves and muscle. Decreased extracellular Ca2+ </p><p>lowers (makes more negative) the threshold potential; </p><p>by lowering threshold potential, less inward current is </p><p>required to depolarize to threshold and to fire action </p><p>potentials. Thus hypocalcemia produces tingling and </p><p>numbness (effects on sensory nerves) and spontane-</p><p>ous muscle twitches (effects on motoneurons and the </p><p>muscle itself).</p><p>Hypercalcemia is an increase in the plasma Ca2+ </p><p>concentration. Manifestations of hypercalcemia include </p><p>constipation, polyuria, polydipsia, and neurologic signs </p><p>of hyporeflexia, lethargy, coma, and death.</p><p>Changes in plasma protein concentration, changes </p><p>in complexing anion concentration, and acid-base dis-</p><p>turbances may alter the forms of Ca2+ in plasma. Such </p><p>changes will be physiologically significant, however, </p><p>only if they alter the ionized Ca2+ concentration because </p><p>that is the form with biologic activity.</p><p>♦ Changes in plasma protein concentration alter the</p><p>total Ca2+ concentration in the same direction as the</p><p>protein concentration; thus increases in protein</p><p>concentration are associated with increases in total</p><p>Ca2+ concentration, and decreases in protein concen-</p><p>tration are associated with decreases in total Ca2+</p><p>concentration. Because changes in plasma protein</p><p>concentration usually are chronic and develop slowly</p><p>over time, they do not cause a parallel change in</p><p>ionized Ca2+ concentration. Regulatory mechanisms</p><p>such as those involving PTH (see later) sense any</p><p>transient change in ionized Ca2+ concentration and</p><p>have time to make the appropriate correction.</p><p>♦ Changes in anion concentration alter the ionized</p><p>Ca2+ concentration by changing the fraction of Ca2+</p><p>complexed with anions. For example, if the plasma</p><p>phosphate concentration increases, the fraction of</p><p>Ca2+ that is complexed increases, thereby decreasing</p><p>the ionized Ca2+ concentration. If the plasma phos-</p><p>phate concentration decreases, the complexed Ca2+</p><p>decreases and the ionized Ca2+ increases.</p><p>♦ Acid-base abnormalities alter the ionized Ca2+ con-</p><p>centration by changing the fraction of Ca2+ bound</p><p>to plasma albumin, as illustrated in Figure 9.34.</p><p>Albumin has negatively charged sites, which can</p><p>bind either H+ ions or Ca2+ ions. In acidemia, there</p><p>is an excess of H+ in blood; thus more H+ binds to</p><p>albumin, leaving fewer sites for Ca2+ to bind. In aci-</p><p>demia, the free ionized Ca2+ concentration increases</p><p>because less Ca2+ is bound to albumin. In alkalemia,</p><p>there is a deficit of H+ in blood, and less H+ will be</p><p>glucagon, and by β-adrenergic agonists. Secretion of </p><p>somatostatin is inhibited by insulin via an intraislet </p><p>paracrine mechanism.</p><p>Pancreatic somatostatin inhibits secretion of insulin </p><p>and glucagon via paracrine actions on the α and β </p><p>cells. Thus somatostatin is secreted by the δ cells in </p><p>response to a meal, diffuses to the nearby α and β cells, </p><p>and inhibits secretion of their respective hormones. </p><p>Apparently, the function of somatostatin is to modulate </p><p>or limit the responses of insulin and glucagon to inges-</p><p>tion of food.</p><p>REGULATION OF CALCIUM AND </p><p>PHOSPHATE METABOLISM</p><p>Forms of Ca2+ in Blood</p><p>The total Ca2+ concentration in blood is normally </p><p>10 mg/dL (Fig. 9.33). Of the total Ca2+, 40% is bound </p><p>to plasma proteins, mainly albumin. The remaining </p><p>60%, which is not protein bound, is ultrafilterable. The </p><p>ultrafilterable component includes a small portion that </p><p>is complexed to anions (e.g., phosphate, sulfate, citrate) </p><p>and free, ionized Ca2+. Free, ionized Ca2+ amounts to </p><p>50% of the total (i.e., 5 mg/dL), and it is the only form </p><p>of Ca2+ that is biologically active.</p><p>Hypocalcemia is a decrease in the plasma Ca2+ </p><p>concentration.

PTH is packaged in secretory </p><p>granules for subsequent release.</p><p>Regulation of Parathyroid Hormone Secretion</p><p>PTH secretion is regulated by the plasma Ca2+ concen-</p><p>tration. As shown in Figure 9.36, when the total Ca2+ </p><p>concentration is in the normal range (i.e., 10 mg/dL) or </p><p>higher, PTH is secreted at a low (basal) level. However, </p><p>when the plasma Ca2+ concentration decreases to less </p><p>than 10 mg/dL, PTH secretion is stimulated, reach-</p><p>ing maximal rates when the Ca2+ concentration is  </p><p>7.5 mg/dL. The relationship between total Ca2+ con-</p><p>centration and PTH secretion is shown in Figure 9.36, </p><p>although it is actually the ionized Ca2+ concentration </p><p>that regulates secretion by the parathyroid glands. </p><p>The response of the parathyroid glands to a decrease </p><p>in ionized Ca2+ concentration is remarkably prompt, </p><p>occurring within seconds. Furthermore, the faster </p><p>the ionized Ca2+ falls, the greater the PTH secretory </p><p>response.</p><p>It may seem paradoxical that the chief cells would </p><p>secrete PTH in response to a decrease in Ca2+ concentra-</p><p>tion because many endocrine glands secrete their </p><p>hormones in response to an increase in intracellular </p><p>Ca2+ concentration. Actually, this is no paradox because </p><p>what is sensed by the chief cells is a decrease in extra-</p><p>cellular Ca2+ concentration, not a decrease in intracel-</p><p>lular Ca2+. The mechanism of PTH secretion is explained </p><p>as follows: The parathyroid cell membrane contains </p><p>Ca2+ sensing receptors that are linked, via a G protein </p><p>(Gq), to phospholipase C. When the extracellular Ca2+ </p><p>concentration is increased, Ca2+ binds to the receptor </p><p>and activates phospholipase C. Activation of phospho-</p><p>lipase C leads to increased levels of IP3/Ca2+, which </p><p>inhibits PTH secretion.

Thus net absorption of Ca2+ is </p><p>200 mg/day (350 mg − 150 mg), and the remaining </p><p>800 mg/day (of the 1000 mg ingested) is excreted in </p><p>feces. The absorbed Ca2+ enters the Ca2+ pool in ECF.</p><p>The person depicted in Figure 9.35 is presumed to </p><p>have no net gain or loss of Ca2+ from bone. Neverthe-</p><p>less, there is continuous bone remodeling, in which </p><p>new bone is formed (deposited) and old bone is </p><p>resorbed. Bone resorption is stimulated by PTH and </p><p>1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol and is inhibited by </p><p>calcitonin.</p><p>Ultimately, to maintain Ca2+ balance, the kidneys </p><p>must excrete the same amount of Ca2+ that is </p><p>ab  sorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, or, in this case,  </p><p>200 mg/day. The renal mechanisms (which are dis-</p><p>cussed in Chapter 6) include filtration of Ca2+, followed </p><p>by extensive reabsorption.</p><p>Parathyroid Hormone</p><p>The role of PTH is to regulate the concentration of Ca2+ </p><p>in ECF (i.e., plasma or serum).

Inhibition of Na+-phosphate cotransport results in </p><p>decreased phosphate reabsorption and phosphaturia </p><p>(increased phosphate excretion).</p><p>The actions of PTH on bone, kidney, and intestine </p><p>are summarized in Figure 9.38 and are described as </p><p>follows:</p><p>♦ Bone. PTH has several actions on bone, some direct</p><p>and some indirect. In bone, PTH receptors are</p><p>located on osteoblasts but not on osteoclasts. Ini-</p><p>tially and transiently, PTH causes an increase in</p><p>decreased, there is decreased Ca2+ binding to the recep-</p><p>tor, which stimulates PTH secretion.</p><p>In addition to these acute (rapid) changes in PTH </p><p>secretion, chronic (long-term) changes in plasma Ca2+ </p><p>concentration alter transcription of the gene for pre-</p><p>proPTH, synthesis and storage of PTH, and growth of </p><p>the parathyroid glands. Thus chronic hypocalcemia </p><p>(decreased plasma Ca2+ concentration) causes second-</p><p>ary hyperparathyroidism, which is characterized by </p><p>increased synthesis and storage of PTH and hyperplasia </p><p>of the parathyroid glands. On the other hand, chronic </p><p>hypercalcemia (increased plasma Ca2+ concentra-</p><p>tion) causes decreased synthesis and storage of PTH, </p><p>increased breakdown of stored PTH, and release of </p><p>inactive PTH fragments into the circulation.</p><p>Magnesium (Mg2+) has parallel, although less </p><p>important, effects on PTH secretion. Thus like hypocal-</p><p>cemia, hypomagnesemia stimulates PTH secretion and </p><p>hypermagnesemia inhibits PTH secretion. An excep-</p><p>tion is the case of severe hypomagnesemia associated </p><p>with chronic Mg2+ depletion (e.g., alcoholism); severe </p><p>hypomagnesemia inhibits PTH synthesis, storage, and </p><p>secretion by the parathyroid glands.</p><p>Complementing the inhibitory effect of increased </p><p>plasma Ca2+ concentration on PTH secretion, 1,25- </p><p>dihydroxycholecalciferol also inhibits PTH synthesis </p><p>and secretion directly.</p><p>Actions of Parathyroid Hormone</p><p>PTH has actions on bone, kidney, and intestine, all of </p><p>which are coordinated to produce an increase in plasma </p><p>Cell of the proximal tubule</p><p>Lumen</p><p>Blood</p><p>1</p><p>cAMP</p><p>Phosphorylation</p><p>protein kinase</p><p>ATP</p><p>PTH</p><p>3</p><p>5</p><p>4</p><p>2</p><p>R</p><p>Gs</p><p>AC</p><p>Na+</p><p>Phosphate</p><p>Fig. 9.37 Mechanism of action of PTH on the renal proximal tubule.

Thus an additional </p><p>mechanism must coordinate with the PTH effect on </p><p>bone to cause the plasma ionized Ca2+ concentration </p><p>to increase. (That additional mechanism is the </p><p>phosphaturic action of PTH.)</p><p>♦ Kidney. PTH has two actions on the kidney. (1) PTH</p><p>inhibits phosphate reabsorption by inhibiting</p><p>Na+-phosphate cotransport in the proximal convo-</p><p>luted tubule. As a result of this action, PTH causes</p><p>phosphaturia, an increased excretion of phosphate</p><p>in urine. The cAMP generated in cells of the proximal</p><p>tubule is excreted in urine and is called nephrogenous </p><p>or urinary cAMP. The phosphaturic action of PTH</p><p>is critical because the phosphate that was resorbed</p><p>from bone is excreted in the urine; this phosphate</p><p>would have otherwise complexed Ca2+ in ECF.</p><p>Excreting phosphate in urine “allows” the plasma</p><p>ionized Ca2+ concentration to increase! (2) PTH</p><p>stimulates Ca2+ reabsorption. This second renal</p><p>action of PTH is on the distal convoluted tubule and</p><p>bone formation by a direct action on osteoblasts. </p><p>(This brief action is the basis for the usefulness of </p><p>intermittent synthetic PTH administration in the </p><p>treatment of osteoporosis.) In a second, long-lasting </p><p>action on osteoclasts, PTH causes an increase in </p><p>bone resorption. This second action on osteoclasts </p><p>is indirect and mediated by cytokines released from </p><p>osteoblasts; these cytokines then increase the </p><p>number and activity of the bone-resorbing osteo-</p><p>clasts. Thus the bone-forming cells, osteoblasts, are </p><p>required for the bone-resorbing action of PTH on </p><p>osteoclasts. When PTH levels are chronically ele-</p><p>vated, as in hyperparathyroidism, the rate of bone </p><p>resorption is persistently elevated, which increases </p><p>the serum Ca2+ concentration.</p><p>The overall effect of PTH on bone is to promote </p><p>bone resorption, delivering both Ca2+ and phosphate </p><p>to ECF. Hydroxyproline that is released from bone </p><p>matrix is excreted in urine.</p><p>Alone, the effects of PTH on bone cannot account </p><p>for its overall action to increase the plasma-ionized </p><p>Ca2+ concentration.

The increased urinary Ca2+ (hypercalci-</p><p>uria) can precipitate in the urine as Ca2+-phosphate </p><p>or Ca2+-oxalate stones. The presence of hypercalciuria </p><p>may seem surprising because the direct effect of PTH </p><p>on the renal tubule is to increase Ca2+ reabsorption, </p><p>thus decreasing Ca2+ excretion. The presence of </p><p>hypercalciuria is explained, however, because the </p><p>high plasma Ca2+ concentration in primary hyper-</p><p>parathyroidism results in a high filtered load of Ca2+, </p><p>which overwhelms the reabsorptive capacity of the </p><p>nephron—the Ca2+ that is not reabsorbed is spilled </p><p>into the urine. Persons with primary hyperparathy-</p><p>roidism are said to have “stones, bones, and </p><p>groans”—stones from hypercalciuria, bones from </p><p>increased bone resorption, and groans from consti-</p><p>pation. Treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism </p><p>usually is parathyroidectomy (surgical removal of </p><p>the parathyroid glands).</p><p>♦ Secondary hyperparathyroidism. The causes of</p><p>secondary hyperparathyroidism are different from</p><p>the causes of primary hyperparathyroidism. In</p><p>primary hyperparathyroidism, the disorder is in the</p><p>parathyroid gland, which is secreting excessive PTH.</p><p>In secondary hyperparathyroidism, the parathyroid</p><p>glands are normal but are stimulated to secrete</p><p>excessive PTH secondary to hypocalcemia, which</p><p>can be caused by vitamin D deficiency or chronic</p><p>renal failure. In secondary hyperparathyroidism,</p><p>circulating levels of PTH are elevated and blood</p><p>levels of Ca2+ are low or normal but never high.</p><p>complements the increase in plasma Ca2+ concentra-</p><p>tion that resulted from the combination of bone </p><p>resorption and phosphaturia.</p><p>♦ Small intestine. PTH does not have direct actions</p><p>on the small intestine, although indirectly it stimu-</p><p>lates intestinal Ca2+ absorption via activation of</p><p>vitamin D. PTH stimulates renal 1α-hydroxylase, the</p><p>enzyme that converts 25-hydroxycholecalciferol to</p><p>the active form, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. In</p><p>turn, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol stimulates intes-</p><p>tinal Ca2+ absorption.</p><p>Pathophysiology of Parathyroid Hormone</p><p>The pathophysiology of the PTH system can involve an </p><p>excess of PTH, a deficiency of PTH, or target tissue </p><p>resistance to PTH.

Primary hyperpara-</p><p>thyroidism is most commonly caused by parathyroid</p><p>adenomas </p><p>(tumors), </p><p>which </p><p>secrete </p><p>excessive</p><p>amounts of PTH (Box 9.3). The consequences of</p><p>primary hyperparathyroidism are predictable from</p><p>the known physiologic actions of PTH on bone,</p><p>kidney, and intestine: increased circulating levels</p><p>of PTH, hypercalcemia, and hypophosphatemia.</p><p>Hypercalcemia results from increased bone re-</p><p>sorption, increased renal Ca2+ reabsorption, and</p><p>increased intestinal Ca2+ absorption.

A 52-year-old woman </p><p>reports that she suffers from symptoms of general-</p><p>ized weakness, easy fatigability, loss of appetite, and </p><p>occasional vomiting. Also, she reports that her urine </p><p>output is higher than normal and that she is unusually </p><p>thirsty. Laboratory tests show hypercalcemia (increased </p><p>serum [Ca2+]), hypophosphatemia (decreased serum </p><p>phosphate concentration), and phosphaturia (increased </p><p>urinary phosphate excretion). Suspecting that the </p><p>woman may have a disorder of the parathyroid glands, </p><p>her physician orders a PTH level, which is found to be </p><p>significantly elevated.</p><p>The woman undergoes surgery, and a single para-</p><p>thyroid adenoma is located and removed. The woman’s </p><p>blood and urine values return to normal. She regains </p><p>her strength and reports feeling well.</p><p>EXPLANATION OF CASE. The woman has primary </p><p>hyperparathyroidism caused by a single parathyroid </p><p>adenoma, a benign lesion. The tumor secretes large </p><p>amounts of PTH chemically identical to the hormone </p><p>secreted by the normal parathyroid glands. This excess </p><p>PTH acts directly on bone and kidney and indirectly </p><p>on the intestine to cause hypercalcemia and hypo-</p><p>phosphatemia. Her hypercalcemia results from the </p><p>effects of PTH to increase bone resorption, renal Ca2+ </p><p>reabsorption, and intestinal Ca2+ absorption via activa-</p><p>tion of vitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. Her </p><p>hypophosphatemia is caused by the effect of PTH to </p><p>decrease renal phosphate reabsorption and produce </p><p>phosphaturia.</p><p>Most of the woman’s symptoms including hypore-</p><p>flexia, weakness, loss of appetite, and vomiting are </p><p>caused by hypercalcemia.

This</p><p>autosomal dominant disorder is characterized by</p><p>decreased urinary Ca2+ excretion and increased</p><p>serum Ca2+ concentration. It is caused by inactivat-</p><p>ing mutations of the Ca2+ sensing receptors in the</p><p>parathyroid glands (that regulate PTH secretion)</p><p>and parallel Ca2+ receptors in the thick, ascending</p><p>limb of the kidney (that mediate Ca2+ reabsorption).</p><p>When the renal receptors are defective, a high serum</p><p>Ca2+ concentration is incorrectly sensed as “normal”</p><p>and Ca2+ reabsorption is increased (leading to</p><p>decreased urinary Ca2+ [hypocalciuria] and increased</p><p>serum Ca2+ concentration). Because the Ca2+ recep-</p><p>tors in the parathyroid glands are also defective, they</p><p>incorrectly sense the increased serum Ca2+ as normal</p><p>and PTH secretion is not inhibited as it would be in</p><p>normal persons.</p><p>Calcitonin</p><p>Calcitonin is a straight-chain peptide with 32 amino </p><p>acids. It is synthesized and secreted by the parafollicu-</p><p>lar or C (“C” for calcitonin) cells of the thyroid gland. </p><p>The calcitonin gene directs the synthesis of preprocal-</p><p>citonin and a signal peptide is cleaved to yield procal-</p><p>citonin; other peptide sequences are then removed, and </p><p>the final hormone, calcitonin, is stored in secretory </p><p>granules for subsequent release.</p><p>The major stimulus for calcitonin secretion is </p><p>increased plasma Ca2+ concentration (contrast this with </p><p>the stimulus for PTH secretion, decreased plasma Ca2+ </p><p>concentration). The major action of calcitonin is to </p><p>inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption, which decreases </p><p>the plasma Ca2+ concentration.</p><p>In contrast to PTH, calcitonin does not participate </p><p>in the minute-to-minute regulation of the plasma Ca2+ </p><p>concentration in humans. In fact, a physiologic role </p><p>for calcitonin in humans is uncertain because neither </p><p>thyroidectomy (with decreased calcitonin levels) nor </p><p>thyroid tumors (with increased calcitonin levels) cause a </p><p>derangement of Ca2+ metabolism, as would be expected </p><p>if calcitonin had important regulatory functions.</p><p>Vitamin D</p><p>Vitamin D, in conjunction with PTH, is the second </p><p>major regulatory hormone for Ca2+ and phosphate </p><p>metabolism. The roles of PTH and vitamin D can be </p><p>distinguished as follows: The role of PTH is to maintain </p><p>the plasma Ca2+ concentration, and its actions are </p><p>♦ Hypoparathyroidism. Hypoparathyroidism is a</p><p>relatively common, inadvertent consequence of</p><p>thyroid surgery (for treatment of thyroid cancer or</p><p>Graves disease) or parathyroid surgery (for treat-</p><p>ment of hyperparathyroidism). Autoimmune and</p><p>congenital hypoparathyroidism are less common.</p><p>The characteristics of hypoparathyroidism are</p><p>predictable: low-circulating levels of PTH, hypo-</p><p>calcemia, and hyperphosphatemia. Hypocalcemia</p><p>results from decreased bone resorption, decreased</p><p>renal Ca2+ reabsorption, and decreased intestinal</p><p>Ca2+ absorption. Hyperphosphatemia results from</p><p>increased phosphate reabsorption. This disorder</p><p>usually is treated with the combination of an oral</p><p>Ca2+ supplement and the active form of vitamin D,</p><p>1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol.</p><p>♦ Pseudohypoparathyroidism. Patients with pseudo-</p><p>hypoparathyroidism type Ia were described in the</p><p>early 1940s by the endocrinologist Fuller Albright as</p><p>follows: They had hypocalcemia, hyperphosphate-</p><p>mia, and a characteristic phenotype consisting of</p><p>short stature, short neck, obesity, subcutaneous</p><p>calcification, and shortened fourth metatarsals and</p><p>metacarpals. Thereafter, this phenotype was called</p><p>Albright hereditary osteodystrophy.</p><p>As in hypoparathyroidism, patients with pseu-</p><p>dohypoparathyroidism </p><p>have </p><p>hypocalcemia </p><p>and </p><p>hyperphosphatemia. However, in pseudohypopara-</p><p>thyroidism, circulating levels of PTH are increased </p><p>rather than decreased, and administration of exog-</p><p>enous PTH produces no phosphaturic response and </p><p>no increase in urinary cAMP. It is now known that </p><p>pseudohypoparathyroidism is an inherited auto-</p><p>somal dominant disorder in which the Gs protein </p><p>for PTH in kidney and bone is defective. When </p><p>PTH binds to its receptor in these tissues, it does </p><p>not activate adenylyl cyclase or produce its usual </p><p>physiologic actions. As a result, hypocalcemia and </p><p>hyperphosphatemia develop.</p><p>♦ Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. Some</p><p>malignant tumors (e.g., lung, breast) secrete</p><p>PTH-related peptide (PTH-rp), which is structur-</p><p>ally homologous with the PTH secreted by the</p><p>parathyroid glands. PTH-rp is not only structurally</p><p>similar but has all the physiologic actions of PTH</p><p>including increased bone resorption, inhibition of</p><p>renal phosphate reabsorption, and increased renal</p><p>Ca2+ reabsorption. Together, the effects of PTH-rp</p><p>on bone and kidney cause hypercalcemia and</p><p>hypophosphatemia, a blood profile similar to that</p><p>seen in primary hyperparathyroidism. However, in</p><p>humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, circulating</p><p>levels of PTH are low, not high (as would occur in</p><p>primary hyperparathyroidism); PTH secretion by the</p><p>parathyroid glands, which are normal, is suppressed</p><p>456 • Physiology</p><p>reticulum and requires NADPH, O2, and Mg2+, but not </p><p>cytochrome P-450. 25-Hydroxycholecalciferol is bound </p><p>to an α-globulin in plasma and is the principal circulat-</p><p>ing form of vitamin D.</p><p>In the kidney, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol under-</p><p>goes one of two routes of hydroxylation: It can  </p><p>be hydroxylated at the C1 position to produce 1,25- </p><p>dihydroxycholecalciferol, which is the physiologi-</p><p>cally active form, or it can be hydroxylated at C24 </p><p>to produce 24,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, which is </p><p>inactive. C1 hydroxylation is catalyzed by the enzyme </p><p>1α-hydroxylase, which is regulated by several factors </p><p>including the plasma Ca2+ concentration and PTH. C1 </p><p>hydroxylation occurs in the renal mitochondria and </p><p>requires NADPH, O2, Mg2+, and cytochrome P-450.</p><p>Regulation of Vitamin D Synthesis</p><p>Whether </p><p>the </p><p>renal </p><p>cells </p><p>produce </p><p>1,25- </p><p>dihydroxycholecalciferol (the active metabolite) or </p><p>24,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (the inactive metabo-</p><p>lite) depends on the “status” of Ca2+ in the body. </p><p>When Ca2+ is sufficient, with an adequate dietary </p><p>intake of Ca2+ and normal or increased plasma Ca2+ </p><p>coordinated to increase the ionized Ca2+ concentration </p><p>toward normal.

A 72-year-old man was </p><p>diagnosed with lung cancer 2 years ago. Despite </p><p>surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, his cancer </p><p>returned. The man decided he did not want further </p><p>treatment and would rather spend his remaining time </p><p>at home with family. In the past week, the man has </p><p>become lethargic and is producing large volumes of </p><p>urine (polyuria). He is also incredibly thirsty and drinks </p><p>water almost constantly. His physician admits him to </p><p>the hospital, where he is found to have significantly </p><p>increased serum Ca2+ concentration and decreased </p><p>serum phosphate concentration. His serum albumin is </p><p>normal and his serum PTH is decreased below normal. </p><p>Serum alkaline phosphatase is very elevated. During a </p><p>brief water-deprivation test, the man’s serum osmolar-</p><p>ity is elevated at 310 mOsm/L and his urine osmolarity </p><p>is 90 mOsm/L; administration of an ADH analogue </p><p>(dDAVP) by nasal spray does not change his serum or </p><p>urine osmolarity.</p><p>EXPLANATION OF CASE. The man has humoral </p><p>hypercalcemia of malignancy, in which his malignant </p><p>lung cancer secretes parathyroid hormone–related </p><p>peptide (PTH-rp). PTH-rp is chemically homologous </p><p>with, and has the biologic actions of, PTH secreted by </p><p>the parathyroid glands. The high levels of PTH-rp cause </p><p>increased bone resorption (evidenced by the elevated </p><p>alkaline phosphatase and increased serum Ca2+ concen-</p><p>tration); decreased renal phosphate reabsorption and </p><p>phosphaturia (evidenced by the decreased serum </p><p>phosphate concentration); and increased renal Ca2+ </p><p>reabsorption (contributing to the increased serum Ca2+ </p><p>concentration). The man’s normal serum albumin </p><p>confirms that the increased total serum Ca2+ is not </p><p>caused by increased protein-bound Ca2+ but rather to </p><p>increased free ionized serum Ca2+. The decreased serum </p><p>PTH level is a result of negative feedback inhibition of </p><p>the high-serum Ca2+ on PTH secretion by the parathy-</p><p>roid gland.</p><p>The combination of an elevated serum osmolarity </p><p>and very dilute urine suggests that the man has devel-</p><p>oped diabetes insipidus, either central or nephrogenic. </p><p>Administration of dDAVP proves that it is nephrogenic </p><p>diabetes insipidus, in which even exogenous ADH does </p><p>not cause his urine to be become concentrated.

In the hospital, the man is given saline </p><p>and furosemide (a loop diuretic) to decrease his serum </p><p>Ca2+ concentration.

Hormone levels are measured</p><p>by radioimmunoassay.</p><p>■ Peptide hormones are synthesized by transcription</p><p>of genes to mRNAs and translation of mRNAs to</p><p>preprohormones. Signal peptides and other peptide</p><p>sequences are cleaved from preprohormones to form</p><p>the peptide hormones, which are packaged in secre-</p><p>tory granules. Steroid hormones are synthesized</p><p>from cholesterol in the adrenal cortex, testes, ovaries,</p><p>and placenta. Amine hormones are derivatives of</p><p>tyrosine.</p><p>■ Hormone synthesis and secretion are regulated by</p><p>negative and positive feedback mechanisms. Nega-</p><p>tive feedback is self-limiting; positive feedback is</p><p>self-augmenting. Hormone receptors are also regu-</p><p>lated by increasing (up-regulation) or decreasing</p><p>(down-regulation) their number or activity.</p><p>■ Mechanisms of hormone action (and their second</p><p>messengers) include adenylyl cyclase (cAMP), phos-</p><p>pholipase C (IP3/Ca2+), steroid hormone mechanism,</p><p>and the tyrosine kinase mechanism.</p><p>■ The connection between the hypothalamus and the</p><p>posterior lobe of the pituitary is neuronal. The cell</p><p>bodies are in the hypothalamus, and the hormones</p><p>are secreted from nerve terminals in the posterior</p><p>lobe of the pituitary. The hypothalamus is connected</p><p>to the anterior lobe of the pituitary by hypothalamic-</p><p>hypophysial portal blood vessels.</p><p>■ Hormones of the anterior lobe are TSH, FSH, LH,</p><p>ACTH, growth hormone, and prolactin. Hormones of</p><p>the posterior lobe are ADH and oxytocin.</p><p>■ Growth hormone is required for growth to normal</p><p>stature and has actions on carbohydrate metabolism,</p><p>protein synthesis, organ growth, and bone growth.</p><p>Many of the actions of growth hormone are medi-</p><p>ated by somatomedins. In children, a deficiency of</p><p>growth hormone causes growth retardation. Excess</p><p>growth hormone causes acromegaly.</p><p>■ Prolactin is responsible for breast development and</p><p>lactogenesis. Prolactin secretion is under tonic inhi-</p><p>bition, mediated by dopamine from the hypothala-</p><p>mus. Excess prolactin secretion (e.g., prolactinoma)</p><p>causes galactorrhea, which can be treated with</p><p>dopamine agonists (e.g., bromocriptine).</p><p>■ ADH is responsible for osmoregulation by increasing</p><p>water reabsorption in the principal cells of the</p><p>diffuses from the lumen into the cell, down its </p><p>electrochemical gradient (Step 1). It is bound inside </p><p>the cell to calbindin D-28K (Step 2) and subsequently </p><p>is pumped across the basolateral membrane by a </p><p>Ca2+ ATPase (Step 3). The exact role of calbindin </p><p>D-28K in promoting absorption in intestinal epithe-</p><p>lial cells is uncertain. It may act as a shuttle, moving </p><p>Ca2+ across the cell from lumen to blood, or it may </p><p>act as a Ca2+ buffer to keep intracellular free Ca2+ </p><p>low, thus maintaining the concentration gradient for </p><p>Ca2+ diffusion across the luminal membrane.</p><p>♦ Kidney. The actions of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol</p><p>on the kidney are parallel to its actions on the</p><p>intestine—it stimulates both Ca2+ and phosphate</p><p>reabsorption. In the kidney, the actions of 1,25-</p><p>dihydroxycholecalciferol are clearly distinguishable</p><p>from those of PTH. PTH stimulates Ca2+ reabsorp-</p><p>tion and inhibits phosphate reabsorption, and</p><p>1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol stimulates the reab-</p><p>sorption of both ions.</p><p>♦ Bone. In bone, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol acts</p><p>synergistically with PTH to stimulate osteoclast</p><p>activity and bone resorption. This action may seem</p><p>paradoxical because the overall action of 1,25-</p><p>dihydroxycholecalciferol is to promote bone mineral-</p><p>ization. However, mineralized “old” bone is resorbed</p><p>to provide more Ca2+ and phosphate to ECF so that</p><p>“new” bone can be mineralized (bone remodeling).</p><p>Pathophysiology of Vitamin D</p><p>In children, vitamin D deficiency causes rickets, a </p><p>condition in which insufficient amounts of Ca2+ and </p><p>phosphate are available to mineralize the growing </p><p>bones. Rickets is characterized by growth failure and </p><p>skeletal deformities. This condition is rare in areas of </p><p>the world where vitamin D is supplemented and when </p><p>there is adequate exposure to sunlight. In adults, </p><p>vitamin D deficiency results in osteomalacia, in which </p><p>new bone fails to mineralize, resulting in bending and </p><p>softening of the weight-bearing bones.</p><p>Vitamin D resistance occurs when the kidney </p><p>is unable to produce the active metabolite, 1,25- </p><p>dihydroxycholecalciferol. This condition is called </p><p>“resistant” because no matter how much vitamin D is </p><p>supplemented in the diet, it will be inactive because </p><p>the C1 hydroxylation step in the kidney is absent or </p><p>is inhibited. Vitamin D resistance can be caused by </p><p>the congenital absence of 1α-hydroxylase or, more </p><p>commonly, by chronic renal failure. Chronic renal </p><p>failure is associated with a constellation of bone </p><p>abnormalities including osteomalacia, a consequence </p><p>of the inability of the diseased renal tissue to produce </p><p>1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, the active form of </p><p>vitamin D.</p><p>9—Endocrine Physiology • 459 </p><p>kidney. The function of vitamin D is to promote bone </p><p>mineralization by increasing the Ca2+ and phosphate </p><p>concentrations in ECF. Its actions are to increase </p><p>intestinal and renal Ca2+ and phosphate absorption </p><p>and to increase bone resorption. Deficiency of </p><p>vitamin D causes rickets in children and osteomala-</p><p>cia in adults.</p><p>kidney. ADH secretion is stimulated by increases in </p><p>serum osmolarity and by decreases in ECF volume. </p><p>Deficiency of ADH causes diabetes insipidus; excess </p><p>ADH causes SIADH.</p><p>■ Oxytocin secretion is stimulated by suckling and is</p><p>responsible for milk ejection from the lactating</p><p>breast.</p><p>■ Thyroid hormones are synthesized by thyroid fol-</p><p>licular cells. Tyrosines of TG are iodinated, yielding</p><p>MIT and DIT. Coupling of MIT and DIT produces</p><p>T3 and T4. T4 is activated to T3 in target tissues.</p><p>The actions of thyroid hormones include increased</p><p>Na+-K+ ATPase, increased oxygen consumption and</p><p>BMR, and increased cardiac output. Hyperthyroid-</p><p>ism is commonly caused by thyroid-stimulating</p><p>immunoglobulins (Graves disease) and exhibits</p><p>weight loss, increased BMR, excess heat production,</p><p>rapid heart rate, and nervousness. Hypothyroidism</p><p>exhibits weight gain, decreased BMR, cold intoler-</p><p>ance, slowed movements, and lethargy.</p><p>■ Adrenocortical steroid hormones are glucocorti-</p><p>coids, mineralocorticoids, and adrenal androgens,</p><p>all of which are synthesized from cholesterol.</p><p>Glucocorticoids stimulate gluconeogenesis and have</p><p>antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive actions.</p><p>Mineralocorticoids stimulate Na+ reabsorption and</p><p>K+ and H+ secretion by the kidney. Addison disease</p><p>is primary adrenocortical insufficiency. Cushing syn-</p><p>drome is overproduction of glucocorticoids. Conn</p><p>syndrome is overproduction of mineralocorticoids.</p><p>■ The islets of Langerhans have three cell types: α,</p><p>which secrete glucagon; β, which secrete insulin;</p><p>and δ, which secrete somatostatin. Insulin is the</p><p>hormone of “abundance” and promotes storage of</p><p>glucose as glycogen, storage of fatty acids in adipose,</p><p>and storage of amino acids as protein. Deficiency of</p><p>insulin is type I diabetes mellitus; insulin resistance</p><p>of target tissues is type II diabetes mellitus. Glucagon</p><p>is the hormone of “starvation” and promotes utiliza-</p><p>tion of stored nutrients.</p><p>■ Ca2+ homeostasis is controlled by the interplay of</p><p>bone, kidney, and intestine and the actions of the</p><p>hormones PTH, calcitonin, and vitamin D. The func-</p><p>tion of PTH is to increase serum ionized Ca2+ con-</p><p>centration by increasing bone resorption, increasing</p><p>intestinal Ca2+ absorption, increasing renal Ca2+</p><p>reabsorption, and decreasing renal phosphate reab-</p><p>sorption. Hyperparathyroidism is associated with</p><p>hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia. Hypopara-</p><p>thyroidism is associated with hypocalcemia and</p><p>hyperphosphatemia.
